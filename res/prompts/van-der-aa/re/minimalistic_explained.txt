# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all constraints contained.

## Definition: actions
An **action** is a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action

## Definitions: constraints
- ** precedence **: the source action needs to precede the target action; often written as a combination of a conditional clause and a modal verb (e.g., can) constraining the target action; this constraint occurs very frequently!
- ** response **: If the source action is executed, the target action is (always) executed as well. But it is not mandatory to execute the source action before; often written as a description of strict sequence of two actions
- ** succession **: If the source action is executed, the target action MUST be executed as well. And it is mandatory to execute the source action before the target action!
- ** init **: if the source action is said to start a process or process instance. There is no target action.
- ** end **: if the source action is said to end a process or process instance. There is no target action.

## Negation

A negative constraint inverts the implication for the target action. For instance, in case of a precedence constraint this means that the target action must not be preceded by the source action.

# Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	<constraint type>	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example (for precedence only; similar for remaining constraint types)

## Input
Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.

## Output
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences do never contain more than three constraints. Most have less. Thus, extract constraints conservatively, i.e., only in case of a high confidence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
