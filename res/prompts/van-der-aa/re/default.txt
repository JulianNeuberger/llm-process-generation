** Task **

Your task is to extract declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
Your goal is to identify constraints between these actions, which dictate the ordering and existence of actions within the process.

** Constraint Types **

**init**: Marks an action as the start of the entire process. It has no target action.
**end**: Marks an action as the end of the whole process. It has no target action.
**precedence**: Specifies that the tail action can only be executed if the head action was already executed before.
**response**: Requires that if the head action was executed, the tail action must also be executed.
**succession**: Specifies that if the head action is executed, the tail action needs to be executed as well, and vice versa.

Additionally, you may encounter negations of constraints, indicated by statements like "do not" or "must not."

** Format **

Please ensure the correct identification and formatting of constraints in the given text. Output one constraint per line, including the sentence id, whether the constraint is negated (TRUE or FALSE), the type of constraint, and the extracted head and tail actions separated by tabs. Stick closely to the provided examples and descriptions, and be careful to distinguish between precedence, response, and succession constraints.

<sentence-id>	<negation>	<type>	<head>	<tail>

** Notes **

Please return raw text, do not use any formatting.
