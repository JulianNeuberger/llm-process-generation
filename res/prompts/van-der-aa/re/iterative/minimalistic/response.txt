# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all response constraints contained.

## Definitions: response
- ** action **: a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action
- ** response **: If the source action is executed, the target action MUST or SHOULD be executed as well. But it is not mandatory to execute the source action before. Only extract a constraint if there is one of the following signal phrases: once/when ... should, if ... must, if/in case ... will


## Negation

A negative response constraint means that the target action must not succeed the source action.

# Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	response	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input
Sentence 0: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.

## Output
0	FALSE	response	call manager	forward request

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences do never contain more than three constraints. Most have less. Thus, extract constraints conservatively, i.e., only in case of a high confidence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
