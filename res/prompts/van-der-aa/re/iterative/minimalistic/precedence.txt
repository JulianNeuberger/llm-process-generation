# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract precedence constraints if you think that the following definitions are fulfilled.

## Definitions: precedence

- ** action **: a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action
- ** precedence **: the source action needs to be carried out to allow for executing the target action. Only extract a constraint if there is one of the following signal words or signal phrases: can, may, must be ... before

## Negation

A negative precedence constraint means that the source action must not precede the target action.

## Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	precedence	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input
Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.

## Output
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences do never contain more than three constraints. Most have less. Thus, extract constraints conservatively, i.e., only in case of a high confidence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes

Do not use any code formatting.
