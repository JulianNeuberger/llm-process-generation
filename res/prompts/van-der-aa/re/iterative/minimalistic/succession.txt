# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all succession constraints contained.

## Definitions: succession
- ** action **: a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action
- ** succession **: If the source action is executed, the target action MUST be executed as well. And it is mandatory to execute the source action before the target action!

## Negation

A negative succession constraint means that the source action must not precede the target action and the target action must not succeed the source action.

# Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	succession	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input
Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product is advertised but never before.

## Output
0	FALSE	succession	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences do never contain more than three constraints. Most have less. Thus, extract constraints pessimistically, i.e., only in case of a high confidence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
