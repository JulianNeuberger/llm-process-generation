# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all init and end constraints contained.

## Definitions: init and end

- ** action **: a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action
- ** init **: if the source action is said to start a process or process instance. There is no target action.
- ** end **: if the source action is said to end a process or process instance. There is no target action.

## Negation

A negative init constraint means that the source action must not start a process. A negative end constraint means that the source action must not end a process.

## Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	<init OR end>	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input
Sentence 0: The process begins when the author submits the paper.
Sentence 1: The process is completed as soon as the proposal is archived.

## Output
0	FALSE	init	submit paper
1	FALSE	end	archive proposal

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences do never contain more than three constraints. Most have less. Thus, extract constraints pessimistically, i.e., only in case of a high confidence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only restricting actions of the same sentence.

# Notes

Do not use any code formatting.
