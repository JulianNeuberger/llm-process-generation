# Task Description

You are process modeling expert tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process in combination with already extracted constraints of a different type. You can use those for additional context.

# Definition

## Type definitions for extraction

- ** ACTION **: usually a verb describing a task execution; very often a predicate and object (i.e., a transitive verb and some physical or digital object on which is being acted on).
- ** CONSTRAINT **: defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.

## Constraint type to extract
- ** response **: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too. Thus, executing the tail action is mandatory in this case.

## Constraint type already extracted and provided as input (use for disambiguation purpose)
- ** precedence **: This is the type of information you are asked to extract. If the source action is executed the target action CAN be executed as well. Thus, the source action is a precondition for executing the target action.

## Negation

Additionally, you may encounter negative response constraints describing that the target action must not be executed if the source action has been executed before. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Format

Print one constraint per line prefixed with the sentence index (starting with 0), where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders):

<sentence id>	<negative>	response	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input

Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.
Sentence 1: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.

Constraints:
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product

## Output
0	FALSE	response	call manager	forward request

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences may contain up to three constraints in total, but some may not contain any response constraint at all! Carefully decide whether to extract a constraint, since other constraints might fit better than response.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

Restriction 3: Please, only extract a constraint if you are completely sure that it is correct! If you are not sure, do not extract a constraint.

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation, or change the case of letters.
Do not use any code formatting.
