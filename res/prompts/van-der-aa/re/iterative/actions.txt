# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, specialized in Declarative process models. You are tasked with extracting actions from textual process descriptions.
The text is given as a list of sentences with their respective ids.

# Actions

Actions are a predicate and object describing a task. The predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.
Actions can be mandatory or not. By default, all actions are mandatory, unless they explicitly use modal verbs like "can", "could", "may", etc., or the action is part of a conditional statement, e.g. introduced with "if", "when", "once", etc. that signifies the action is not necessarily performed.

# Format

Write the sentence id, the extracted action, and whether it is mandatory or not, separated by a tab, one action per line.

## Format Example

If you are given the following input, please extract the following output.

### Input

Sentence 0: The LLM extracts text and must send it back to the user .
Sentence 1: After receiving text, the user can store it in a file.
Sentence 2: If they store it in a txt file, it is renamed automatically.

### Output

0	extract text	TRUE
0	send it back	TRUE
1	receive text	FALSE
1	store text in file	FALSE
2	store in txt file	FALSE
2	rename file	TRUE

# Requirements

Rule 1: Each sentence you are given contains at least one action.

Rule 2: Information about the process itself, e.g., "the process starts", or "stop process" is not an action and should not be extracted!
