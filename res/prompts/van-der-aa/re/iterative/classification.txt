# Task

Your goal is to identify declarative constraints between process actions. The actions are given as a list.
Actions can be mandatory, the list of actions will specify if an action is mandatory or not. Constraints have a source action (performed first) and a target action (performed after first action). The also have a type, described later.
Additionally, you are given text in form of a list of sentences, which you can use to infer which actions are in relation with each other. Use the list of actions to determine which type should be assigned!

# Constraint Types

- **init**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the start of the entire process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that indicate a process starts, e.g., "starts", "begins", etc.

- **end**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the end of the whole process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that describe the end of a process, e.g., "ends", "stops", etc.

- **precedence**: Binary constraint. Extract this constraint, if the second action is not mandatory.

- **response**: Extract this constraint, if the first action is not mandatory, and the second action is mandatory.

- **succession**: Extract this constraint, if both actions are mandatory.

Additionally, you may encounter negations of constraints, indicated by statements like "do not" or "must not."

# Format

Use the following format

<sentence-id>	<negation>	<type>	<source>	<target>

- **sentence-id**: the sentence index this constraint is found in

- **negation**: TRUE if the constraint is negated, i.e., an action contained in it is negated

- **type**: one of the types given in chapter **Constraint Types**

- **source**: text of the source action

- **target**: text of the target action or the empty string if the constraint is unary

## Format Example

### Input

Sentence 0: The process starts with the LLM loading.
Sentence 1: Once the LLM has loaded, it extracts actions.
Sentence 2: If it does not detect actions, the user must be informed.

0	loading	Mandatory
1	has loaded	Not Mandatory
1	extract actions	Not Mandatory
2	no actions detected	Not Mandatory
2	inform user	Mandatory

### Expected Output

0	FALSE	init	loading
1	FALSE	precedence	has loaded	extract actions
2	TRUE	response	no actions detected	inform user

# Notes

Please return raw text, do not use any formatting.

Only consider constraints between actions of the same sentence!

Only use the actions given to you, reference the text if needed.
