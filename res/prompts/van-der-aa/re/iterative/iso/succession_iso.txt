# Task Description

You are an algorithm tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process.

# Definition

## Type definitions for extraction

- ** ACTION **: usually a verb describing a task execution; very often a predicate and object (i.e., a transitive verb and some physical or digital object on which is being acted on).

- ** succession **: The target action cannot be executed before the source action, but once the source action has been executed, it is mandatory to also execute the target action.

## Negation

Additionally, you may encounter negative succession constraints describing that if the source action is carried out the target action must not be executed and if the target action is executed it must not be preceded by the source action. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Format

Print one constraint per line prefixed with the sentence index (starting with 0), where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders):

<sentence id>	<negative>	succession	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input

** Sentence 0 **
After signing the contract, the product is advertised but never before.

** Sentence 1**
When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.

## Output
0	FALSE	succession	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences may contain up to three constraints in total, but some may not contain any succession constraint at all! Carefully decide whether to extract a constraint, since other constraints might fit better than succession.
Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
