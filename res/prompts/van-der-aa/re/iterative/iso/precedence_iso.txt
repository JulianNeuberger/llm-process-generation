# Task Description

You are process modeling expert tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process.

# Definition

## Type definitions

- ** ACTION **: usually a verb describing a task execution; very often a predicate and object (i.e., a transitive verb and some physical or digital object on which is being acted on).

- ** precedence **: This is the type of information you are asked to extract. If the source action is executed the target action CAN be executed as well. Thus, the source action is a precondition for executing the target action.

## Negation

Additionally, you may encounter negative precedence constraints describing that the target action can only be executed if the source action does not have been executed before. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Format

Print one constraint per line prefixed with the sentence index (starting with 0), where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders):

<sentence id>	<negative>	precedence	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input

** Sentence 0 **
After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.

Constraints:

## Output
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences may contain up to three constraints in total, but some may not contain any precedence constraint at all! Carefully decide whether to extract a constraint, since other constraints might fit better than precedence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation, or change the case of letters.
Do not use any code formatting.
