# Task

Your goal is to identify unary declarative constraints for process actions in natural language text.

# Actions

Actions are a predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.

# Constraint Types

- **init**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the start of the entire process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that indicate a process starts, e.g., "starts", "begins", etc. Usually only one per process.

- **end**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the end of the whole process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that describe the end of a process, e.g., "ends", "stops", etc. Usually only one per process.

# Format

Use the following format

<sentence-id>	FALSE	<type>	<source>

- **sentence-id**: the sentence index this constraint is found in

- **type**: one of the types given in chapter **Constraint Types**

- **source**: text of the action that has the unary constraint

# Notes

Please return raw text, do not use any formatting.

Only consider constraints between actions of the same sentence!
