# Task Description

You are a process modeling expert tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process.

# Definition

## Types:

- ** ACTION **: usually a verb describing a task execution; very often a predicate and object (i.e., a transitive verb and some physical or digital object on which is being acted on).
- ** CONSTRAINT **: defines if and how an action can be executed.

## Constraint types:
- ** init **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is started by a particular action (signal words such as "first" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the init constraint. There is no target action. Abstract input example: "The process is started when activity XY is carried out."

- ** end **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is ended by a particular action (signal words such as "last" or "finally" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the end constraint. There is no target action. Abstract input example: "The process ends when activity XY is performed."

## Negation

Additionally, you may encounter negative init or end constraints describing that the source activity cannot start/end a process. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Format

Print one constraint per line prefixed with the sentence index (starting with 0), where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders, replace <init|end> by the constraint type you have found):

<sentence id>	<negative>	<init|end>	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example

## Input

** Sentence 0 **
The process begins when the author submits the paper.

** Sentence 1 **
The process is completed as soon as the proposal is archived

## Output
0	FALSE	init	submit paper
1	FALSE	end	archive proposal

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only restricting actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
