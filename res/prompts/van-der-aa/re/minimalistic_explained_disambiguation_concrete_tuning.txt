# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all constraints contained.

## Definition: actions
An **action** is a verb describing a task execution. It often consists of a transitive verb in combination with an object. When extracting actions as arguments of constraints (see definitions below) only extract verbs and, if present, corresponding objects from a sentence! You may also transform them grammatically.

## Definitions: constraints
- ** precedence **: After performing a particular action (source), some other action (target) may be carried out afterwards. Modal verbs that express non-mandatory conditions (e.g., can, may, might) are clear signal words for this constraint type.
- ** response **: After performing a particular action (source), some other action (target) has to be carried out afterwards. If the sentence or a clause reads like a description of strict sequence of two actions, this is a good sign for a response constraint. However, if there are modal verbs that express non-mandatory conditions (e.g., can, may, might) this is a clear signal that it is NOT a response constraint.
- ** succession **: After performing a particular action (source), some other action (target) has to be carried out afterwards. And it is mandatory to execute the source action before the target action! Only extract this constraint if both of these criteria hold.
- ** init **: An action (source) explicitly starts a process or process instance. There is no target action.
- ** end **: An action (target) explicitly ends a process or process instance. There is no target action.

## Negation

A negative constraint inverts the implication for the target action. For instance, in case of a precedence constraint this means that the target action must not be preceded by the source action.

# Disambiguation

The constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between response and precedence, carefully analyze whether the target action CAN be performed
because the source action has already been performed (precedence), or whether the target action MUST THEREFORE be performed (response). If BOTH is true, it is a succession constraint. Thus, again, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.
The following abstract examples illustrate the differences:

- Example 1: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.
    -- Correct constraint: precedence
    -- Wrong are response and succession, though the product can be advertised, it is not necessary. The response is also wrong, because it does not require an execution of an action before something else can be executed.
- Example 2: After signing the contract, the product is advertised but never before.
    -- Correct constraint: succession
    -- Response and precedence would be correct but are already contained in succession and are, thus, not extracted.
- Example 3: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.
    -- Correct constraint: response
    -- Succession and response are wrong, because the given sentence implies the request can be forwarded to the secretary without calling the manager before.

# Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	<constraint type>	<source action>	<target action>

# Format example (for precedence only; similar for remaining constraint types)

## Input
Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.
Sentence 1: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.
Sentence 2: After signing the contract, the product is always advertised but never before.

## Output
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product
1	FALSE	response	call manager	forward request
2	FALSE	succession	sign contract	advertise product

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Do not extract more than three constraints per sentence.

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of the same sentence.

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
