# Task Description

You are a business process analyst tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
Your goal is to identify constraints between these actions, which dictate the ordering and existence of actions within the process.

# Type Definitions

## Overview
- ** ACTION **: predicate and object of a sentence describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on. Transform the predicate into the infinitive (e.g. "he submits the paper" would lead to "submit paper").

- ** CONSTRAINT **: defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source action and sometimes a target action, depending on the type.

## Constraint Types

- ** init **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is started by a particular action (signal words such as "first" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the init constraint. There is no target action. Abstract input example: "The process is started when activity XY is carried out."

- ** end **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is ended by a particular action (signal words such as "last" or "finally" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the end constraint. There is no target action. Abstract input example: "The process ends when activity XY is performed."

- ** precedence **: holds if executing the source action enables the execution of the target action. Abstract input example: "If activity A has been conducted, (usually) activity B is conducted."

- ** response **: holds if executing the source action requires that the target action is executed, too. Abstract input example: "If activity A has been conducted, activity B needs to be carried out."

- ** succession **: combination of **precedence** and **response**. Thus, source and targe action are executed exactly in the ordering stated in the sentence. Abstract input example: "If activity A has been conducted, activity B can and will be conducted, too."

## Negation

You might encounter negative constraints indicated by formulations stating that "if something is done, something else is not allowed anymore." statements like "do not" or "must not." A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Disambiguation

The constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the target action CAN be performed
because the source action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the target action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint. Thus, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.
However, if you recognize an action in a sentence and there is no other action, it is NEVER a Precedence, Response or Succession constraint.
The following abstract examples illustrate the differences:

- Example 1: If action A is performed, action B can be carried out. (precedence)
- Example 2: If action A is performed, action B is carried out, too. (response)
- Example 3: If action A is performed, action B can and must also be performed carried out. (succession)

# Procedure

Let's carry out your task in two steps.

- Step 1: First, extract all actions contained in the input sentence and list them under the heading "Actions:" line by line (a description how you can identify actions is given in ACTION (Def.) above).

- Step 2: Second, identify and extract constraints based on the constraint types above (see "Constraint Types"). To do this, only use the actions that you defined in Step 1, under the heading "Actions:".

# Format

Print one constraint per line prefixed with the sentence index (starting with 0), where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the CONSTRAINT TYPE, and the extracted ACTIONS by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders):
<sentence index>    <TRUE or FALSE>	<constraint type>	<head action>	<tail action>

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Sentences may contain up to three constraints, but some may contain no constraints at all!

Restriction 2: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of one sentence.

Restriction 3: Make sure that for Step 1 you generate actions in the form of 'predicate object', which usually consists of a transitive verb and the corresponding object. It must be an actual task, described in the same sentence.
