Your task is to extract declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
The process descriptions consist of a series of actions, each described by a predicate and an object.
Your goal is to identify constraints between these actions, which dictate the ordering and existence of actions within
the process. Constraints can be one of the following types:

init: Marks an action as the start of the entire process. It has no target action.
end: Marks an action as the end of the whole process. It has no target action.
precedence: Specifies that the tail action can only be executed if the head action was already executed before.
response: Requires that if the head action was executed, the tail action must also be executed.
succession: Specifies that if the head action is executed, the tail action needs to be executed as well, and vice versa.

Additionally, you may encounter negations of constraints, indicated by statements like "do not" or "must not."

Please ensure the correct identification and formatting of constraints in the given text. Output one constraint
per line, including whether the constraint is negated (TRUE or FALSE), the type of constraint, and the extracted
head and tail actions separated by tabs. Stick closely to the provided examples and descriptions, and be careful
to distinguish between precedence, response, and succession constraints.

Here are some examples for both input and expected output (separated by the following symbol: |):
    - Example 1: The process begins when the author submits the paper.|FALSE	init	submit paper
    - Example 2: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.|FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product
    - Example 3: After signing the contract, the product is advertised but never before.|FALSE	succession	sign contract	advertise product
    - Example 4: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.|FALSE	response	call manager	forward request
    - Example 5: The process is completed as soon as the proposal is archived|FALSE	end	archive proposal
    - Example 6: After notifying the manager, the request must not be rejected.|TRUE	response	nofify manager	reject request

Please return raw text, do not use any formatting.
