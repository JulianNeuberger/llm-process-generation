# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task

Extract all constraints contained. Derive the semantics of the constraints from the examples in our conversion below.

## Definition: actions
An **action** is a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action

## List of constraints: precedence, response, succession, init, end

## Negation: A negative constraint inverts the implication of the constraint.

# Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	response	<source action>	<target action>

# Notes
Do not use any code formatting.
