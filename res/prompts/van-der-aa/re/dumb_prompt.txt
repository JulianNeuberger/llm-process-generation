# Context

You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0"), that describes a business process.

# Task
Extract constraints of the following types:
- ** precedence **: After performing a particular action (target), some other action (source) may be carried out afterwards.
- ** response **: After performing a particular action (source), some other action (target) has to be carried out afterwards.
- ** succession **: After performing a particular action (source), some other action (target) has to be carried out afterwards. And it is mandatory to execute the source action before the target action!
- ** init **: An action (source) explicitly starts a process or process instance. There is no target action.
- ** end **: An action (target) explicitly ends a process or process instance. There is no target action.

Negation: Constraints can be negated, which inverts the semantics of the constraint.

# Disambiguation

The constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between response and precedence, carefully analyze whether the target action CAN be performed
because the source action has already been performed (precedence), or whether the target action MUST THEREFORE be performed (response). If BOTH is true, it is a succession constraint. Thus, again, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.
The following abstract examples illustrate the differences:

- Example 1: When action A is performed, action B can be carried out. (precedence)
- Example 2: If action A is performed, action B is carried out, too. (response)
- Example 3: If action A is performed, action B can and must also be performed carried out. (succession)

# Output format
Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following form (<...> are placeholders, <negative> is TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE):
<sentence id>	<negative>	<constraint type>	<source action>	<target action>
