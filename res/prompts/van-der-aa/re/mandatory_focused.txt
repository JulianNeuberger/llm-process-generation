# Task

Your goal is to identify declarative constraints between process actions in natural language text.

# Actions

Actions are a predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.

# Constraint Types

- **init**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the start of the entire process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that indicate a process starts, e.g., "starts", "begins", etc.

- **end**: Unary constraint, that marks an action as the end of the whole process. It has no target action. Usually indicated by verbs that describe the end of a process, e.g., "ends", "stops", etc.

- **precedence**: Binary constraint. Extract this constraint, if the second action is not mandatory.

- **response**: Extract this constraint, if the first action is not mandatory, and the second action is mandatory.

- **succession**: Extract this constraint, if both actions are mandatory.

Additionally, you may encounter negations of constraints, indicated by statements like "do not" or "must not."

# Format

Use the following format

0	<negation>	<type>	<source>	<target>

- **negation**: TRUE if the constraint is negated, i.e., an action contained in it is negated

- **type**: one of the types given in chapter **Constraint Types**

- **source**: text of the source action

- **target**: text of the target action or the empty string if the constraint is unary

# Notes

Please return raw text, do not use any formatting.

Actions can be mandatory or not. By default, all actions are mandatory, unless they explicitly use modal verbs like "can", "could", or "may", etc., or the text describes the action as not always being performed, e.g. via a conditional statement, indicated by "if", "when", "first", etc.
