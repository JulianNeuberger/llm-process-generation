# Task Description

You are a business process analyst tasked with extracting declarative process models from natural language process descriptions.
Your goal is to identify constraints between these actions, which dictate the ordering and existence of actions within the process.

# Type Definitions

## Overview
- ** ACTION **: predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.

- ** CONSTRAINT **: defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source action and sometimes a target action, depending on the type.

## Constraint Types

- ** init **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is started by a particular action (signal words such as "first" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the init constraint. There is no target action.

- ** end **: holds if the sentence explicitly states that the PROCESS is ended by a particular action (signal words such as "last" or "finally" are not sufficient). This action is the source action of the end constraint. There is no target action.

- ** precedence **: holds if executing the source action enables the execution of the target action.

- ** response **: holds if executing the source action requires that the target action is executed, too.

- ** succession **: combination of **precedence** and **response**. Thus, source and targe action are executed exactly in the ordering stated in the sentence.

## Negation

Additionally, you may encounter negative constraints, indicated by statements like "do not" or "must not." Negations invert the restriction of the target activity. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.

# Disambiguation

The constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the target action CAN be performed
because the source action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the target action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint. Thus, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.
However, if you recognize an action in a sentence and there is no other action, it is NEVER a Precedence, Response or Succession constraint.
The following abstract examples illustrate the differences:

- Example 1: If action A is performed, action B can be carried out. (precedence)
- Example 2: If action A is performed, action B is carried out, too. (response)
- Example 3: If action A is performed, action B can and must also be performed carried out. (succession)

# Format

Please ensure the correct identification and formatting of constraints in the given text. Output one constraint per line, including whether the constraint is negated (TRUE or FALSE), the type of constraint, and the extracted source and target actions separated by tabs. Stick closely to the provided examples and descriptions, and be careful to distinguish between precedence, response, and succession constraints.

Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders):

<negative>	<constraint type>	<source action>	<target action>

# Procedure

Let's carry out your task in two steps.

- Step 1: First, extract all actions contained in the input sentence and list them under the heading "Actions:" line by line (a description how you can identify actions is given in ACTION (Def.) above).

- Step 2: Second, identify and extract constraints based on the constraint types above (see "Constraint Types"). To do this, only use the actions that you defined in Step 1, under the heading "Actions:".

# Important Restriction

Restriction 1: Make sure that for Step 1 you generate actions in the form of 'predicate object', which usually consists of a transitive verb and the corresponding object. It must be an actual task, described in the same sentence.

Restriction 2: Sentences may contain up to three constraints, but some may contain no constraints at all!

Restriction 3: You may use the context between sentences, but constraints are always only between actions of one sentence.

# Example

Here is an example for input and expected output:

## Input:

Sentence 0: The process begins when the author submits the paper.
Sentence 1: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.
Sentence 2: After signing the contract, the product is advertised but never before.
Sentence 3: When the manager is called, the request needs to be forwarded to the secretary, too.
Sentence 4: The process is completed as soon as the proposal is archived
Sentence 5: After notifying the manager, the request must not be rejected.

## Output:

** Sentence 0 **

Actions:
submit paper

Constraints:
FALSE	init	submit paper

** Sentence 1 **

Actions:
sign contract
advertise product

Constraints:
FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product

** Sentence 2 **

Actions:
sign contract
advertise product

Constraints:
FALSE	succession	sign contract	advertise product

** Sentence 3 **

Actions:
call manager
forward request

Constraints:
FALSE	response	call manager	forward request

** Sentence 4 **

Actions:
archive proposal

Constraints:
0	FALSE	end	archive proposal

** Sentence 5 **

Actions:
nofify manager
reject request

Constraints:
TRUE	response	nofify manager	reject request
