# Task Description

You are tasked with extracting constraints between actions from a natural language sentence containing a process description.

## Definition: actions
An **action** is a verb describing a task execution; often transitive in combination with an object; an action is either a source action or a target action depending on whether it is the restricting or the restricted action

## Definitions: constraints
- ** precedence **: the source action needs to precede the target action; often written as a combination of a conditional clause and a modal verb (e.g., can) constraining the target action; this constraint occurs very frequently!

- ** response **: executing source action is executed, the target action is (always) executed as well. But it is not mandatory to execute the source action before; often written as a description of strict sequence of two actions

- ** succession **: If the source action is executed, the target action MUST be executed as well. And it is mandatory to execute the source action before the target action!

- ** init **: if the source action is said to start a process or process instance. There is no target action.

- ** end **: if the source action is said to end a process or process instance. There is no target action.

- ** existence **: if the execution of a source action is MANDATORY in the process, but it does NOT depend on any other action; thus, there is no target action

- ** absence **: if the execution of a source action is FORBIDDEN in the process, but it does NOT depend on any other action; thus, there is no target action ; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence constraint.

- ** noncooccurrence **: indicates that two actions are mutually exclusive and therefore cannot both be executed

## Procedure

Let's solve the task in two steps.

- Step 1: First, extract all actions contained in the input sentence and list them under the heading "Actions:" line by line (a description how you can identify actions is given in ACTION (Def.) above).

- Step 2: Second, identify and extract constraints based on the constraint types above (see "Constraint Types"). To do this, only use the actions that you defined in Step 1, under the heading "Actions:".


# Restrictions

Make sure that for Step 1 you generate actions in the form of 'predicate object', which usually consists of a transitive verb and the corresponding object. It must be an actual task, described in the same sentence.

A sentence may contain up to three constraints!

Do not use any code formatting.

Only extract constraints defined in the task description above.

## Disambiguation

This sentence does neither contain an existence constraint nor a response constraint, because the target activity only needs to be executed in case that the source activity is executed: "If the letter is written by hand, it is sent by post."

## Format

Print the constraints line by line prefixed with the sentence id in the following format:
<sentence id>	<negative>	<constraint type>	<source action>	<target action>

### Placeholders
- <sentence id>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the constraint was found in the input. Zero based.
- <negative>: TRUE if the sentence describes a negative constraint, else: FALSE
- <constraint>: constraint type from the constraint definitions
- <source action>: The action that usually requires something related to the target action
- <target action>: The action that is able to fulfill the requirement related to the source action

## Format Example
### Input:
Sentence 0: After signing the contract, the product can be advertised.

### Output
0	FALSE	precedence	sign contract	advertise product
