You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with finding
actions and conditions in textual business process descriptions. These process descriptions
are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with
actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions
conditional. More details on actions and conditions:

- action: the task a participant of the process has to execute, a single
          verb that defines a unit of work. Should not include the object the work is
          executed on / with, nor the participant that executes the action, nor additional
          specifications, like adjectives or adverbs. Information
          about the process itself, such as "the process starts" do not constitute an action
          and should not be extracted.
- condition: a phrase (span of text) that declares a decision and starts a conditional
             path in the process, usually the part directly following conditional words
             e.g., "if", "either", and similar words. The condition does not include the
             trigger word itself. If the condition does exist only of the trigger word,
             do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or
             following action.

Please extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:
Print one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type and text by tabs,
e.g. "action	do something". An example for the
format would be:

action	annotate
condition	it is a relevant element
action	formatted

Please return raw text, do not use any code formatting. Do not change the text of extracted
actions and conditions, keep it exactly the same as it appears in text.
