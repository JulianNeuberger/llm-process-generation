** Background **

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with finding actions and conditions in textual business process descriptions. These process descriptions are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions  conditional. More details on actions and conditions:

** Definition **

- **action**: the task a participant of the process has to execute, or a task that affects a process participant, a single verb that defines a unit of work. Should not include the object the work is executed on / with, nor the participant that executes the action, nor additional specifications, like adjectives or adverbs. Information about the process itself, such as "the process starts" do not constitute an action and should not be extracted.

- **condition**: a phrase (span of text) that declares a decision and starts a conditional path in the process, usually the part directly following conditionals, adverbs, etc. The condition does not include the trigger word itself. If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action. Actions that are mutually exclusive (usually indicated by phrases like "or", "either") are also marked as *two* separate Condition elements, and the trigger word (e.g., "or") is not included.

** Format **

Please extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:
Print one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type, its text, and a short explanation why you extracted it, by tabs, e.g. "action	do something	this is an active task in the process".

<type>	<text>	<explanation>

** Format Example **

The LLM annotates a span of natural language text, if it is a relevant element, or skips it. then it returns it, after it formatted it correctly.

action	annotates	action a process participant (the LLM) executes, which is process relevant, as it describes a task
condition	it is a relevant element	this statement follows a conditional "if" and explains the condition
condition	skips	this is not an action, as it is mutually exclusive with the previous condition "it is a relevant element", there for it is a condition as well
action	returns	action a process participant (the LLM) does, relevant to the process
action	formatted	action a process participant (the LLM) did, which is still relevant to the process, as it was done after "annotates" and before "returns"

** Notes **

Please return raw text, do not use any code formatting. Do not change the text of extracted
actions and conditions, keep it exactly the same as it appears in text.
