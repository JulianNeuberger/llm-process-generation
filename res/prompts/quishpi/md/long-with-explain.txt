# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with finding actions and conditions in textual business process descriptions. These process descriptions are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions  conditional. More details on actions and conditions:

# Definitions

- **action**: the task a participant of the process has to execute, a single verb that defines a unit of work. Should not include the object the work is executed on / with, nor the participant that executes the action, nor additional specifications, like adjectives or adverbs. Information about the process itself, such as "the process starts" do not constitute an action and should not be extracted.

- **condition**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. conditional or exclusive work streams, usually indicated by a conjunction, an adverb, or other phrases that indicate a condition. These are only relevant, if they introduce a conditional action or mutually exclusive actions. Extract the text directly following the trigger word / phrase, if this text describes the condition, if it is just the trigger word / phrase, do not extract it.

# Format

Please extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:
Print one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type, its text, and a short explanation why you extracted it, by tabs:

<type>	<text>	<explanation>

# Requirements

Rule 1. Actions are just the verb, nothing more, i.e., no auxiliary words, nor specifications on how an action is performed, who performs it, or what data is used during performing it.

Rule 2. Conditions never include the phrase or word, that indicate a condition, i.e., if you hypothetically were to write "if" before the text you extract, it would be a valid sentence.

Rule 3. The only types that you are allowed to extract, are the ones given in chapter **Definitions**.

# Notes

Please return raw text, do not use any code formatting. Do not change the text of extracted actions and conditions, keep it exactly the same as it appears in text.
