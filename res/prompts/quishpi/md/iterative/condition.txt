# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with finding conditions in textual business process descriptions. These process descriptions are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions conditional.

# Definitions

- **condition**: Focus on verb predicates and nominal predicates. If the predicate is part of a) a conditional sub-sentence, extract the conditional sub-sentence, without the trigger word (e.g., "if"). Don't include to much, i.e., not the next task, if it is separated by a comma. If the predicate is b) part of a description of mutually exclusive tasks (e.g. a list joined by "or"), extract the predicate. The condition must be for a process relevant task, not a verb that describes the process lifecylce, e.g. "the process ends". Extract all "otherwise" as conditions. The condition may not be started by "otherwise"!

# Format

# Notes

Please return raw text, do not use any code formatting. Do not change the text of extracted conditions, keep it exactly the same as it appears in text.
