# Task

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying the flow between business process relevant tasks in textual descriptions of business processes.
These tasks have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it. There are also some relations already extracted, which you can use for context during extracting flows.

# Definition

Flows are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention.

**Flow**: Focus on the behavioural elements, which are mentions of types "Activity", "XOR_Gateway", "AND_Gateway", and "Condition_Specification". Extract the flow between behavioural elements, i.e., extract a relation of type "flow", if the text describes that one behavioural element is relevant during the process, before another behavioural element is.
A flow relation between one behavioural element means, that it is relevant before another behavioural element, when the process is executed, e.g., if there is a flow between an "XOR_Gateway" and a "Condition_Specification" the XOR_Gateway is visited first (like an exclusive gateway in a BPMN process model), then the condition specification is relevant (like the condition in a BPMN process model). Afterwards there may be a flow between this "Condition_Specification" and an "Activity", because the condition is relevant first, and if it is fulfilled the employee has to perform the activity.

# Format

Retrieve a relation by listing the type (always "flow"), the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.

flow	<source-mention-index>	<target-mention-index>

## Format Examples

Given the following input:

the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> and <activity id=3> sends </activity> <activity_data id=4> it </activity_data> back .

You will extract these relations

flow	0	3
