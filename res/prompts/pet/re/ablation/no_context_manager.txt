# Task

You are tasked with identifying relations between mentions of business process relevant facts in textual descriptions of business processes.
These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.

# Relation Types

Relations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.

- **uses**: Find the "activity_data" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of an activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "uses". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the "activity_data" mention.

- **flow**: If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).

- **actor performer**: connect the actor that performs the activity with a relation of type "actor performer". The source mention is the "activity", and the target mention is the "actor".

- **actor recipient**: Find the actor that receives the result of some activity execution. If you find one, extract a relation of type "actor recipient". The source mention is the "Activity", the target mention is the "Actor".

- **same gateway**: If you two gateways of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type "same gateway", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.

- **further specification**: Try and find mentions of type "further_specification" that further describes an activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "further_specification", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type "further_specification".

# Format

Retrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.

<relation-type>	<source-mention-index>	<target-mention-index>

## Format Examples

Given the following input:

Sentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .

You will extract these relations

actor performer	0	1
uses	0	2
