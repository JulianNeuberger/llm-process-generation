# Task

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying relations between mentions of business process relevant facts in textual descriptions of business processes.
These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.

# Relation Types

Relations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.

- **uses**: Relation between activity and activity_data, if activity uses activity_data.

- **flow**: Relation marking sequence flow between behavioural elements (activity, xor_gateway, and_gateway, condition_specification).

- **actor performer**: Relation marking the actor that performs an activity.

- **actor recipient**: Relation marking the actor that receives the effects of an activity.

- **same gateway**: Relation marking two descriptions of gateways as the same element.

- **further specification**: Links further_specification to the corresponding activity.

# Format

Retrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.

<relation-type>	<source-mention-index>	<target-mention-index>

## Format Examples

Given the following input:

Sentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .

You will extract these relations

actor performer	0	1
uses	0	2

# Restrictions

Rule 1. Only extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.
