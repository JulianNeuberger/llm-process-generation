# Task

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying relations between mentions of business process relevant facts in textual descriptions of business processes.
These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.

# Relation Types

Relations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.

- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type "activity". Find the "activity_data" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "uses". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the "activity_data" mention.

- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types "Activity", "XOR_Gateway", "AND_Gateway", and "Condition_Specification". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).

- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type "activity" and look for the "actor", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type "actor performer". The source mention is the "activity", and the target mention is the "actor".

- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type "activity" and look for the "actor", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "actor recipient". The source mention is the "Activity", the target mention is the "Actor".

- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type "xor_gateway" and "and_gateway". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type "same gateway", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.

- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type "activity". Try and find mentions of type "further_specification", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type "further_specification", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type "further_specification".

# Format

Retrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.

# Restrictions

Rule 1. Only extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.
