## Task

As a specialist in business process modeling, your objective is to recognize relationships between mentions of pertinent facts in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions, annotated with XML-style tags containing IDs, signify various types of data.

## Relation Types

Relations are directional, involving a source mention and a target mention, categorized as follows:

- **uses**: Pertains to mentions of type "activity." Identify the "activity_data" mention associated with the execution of the activity. If found, establish a "uses" relation where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the "activity_data" mention.

- **flow**: Applies to mentions of types "Activity," "XOR_Gateway," "AND_Gateway," and "Condition_Specification." Establish connections based on the sequence of appearance: if a Condition_Specification follows an XOR_Gateway, link the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows another of these, link the preceding one (source) to the subsequent one (target).

- **actor performer**: Targets mentions of type "activity" to identify the active performer ("actor") of the activity. Establish a "actor performer" relation where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the actor.

- **actor recipient**: Targets mentions of type "activity" to identify the recipient ("actor") of the activity's result. Establish an "actor recipient" relation where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the actor.

- **same gateway**: Connects disjointed descriptions of gateways, focusing on mentions of type "xor_gateway" and "and_gateway." If two mentions of the same type describe the same decision point, establish a "same gateway" relation where the earlier mention in the text is the source and the later mention is the target.

- **further specification**: Targets mentions of type "activity" to find "further_specification" mentions that provide additional details about the activity. Establish a "further_specification" relation where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the "further_specification."

## Format

Retrieve relations by listing the relation type, the index of the head mention, and the index of the tail mention, separated by tabs. Each relation should be listed on a separate line.

<relation-type>	<head-mention-index>	<tail-mention-index>

## Format Examples

Given the following input:

Sentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .

The extracted relations are:

actor performer	0	1
uses	0	2

## Restrictions

Rule 1: Extract relations only if their types are defined in the "Relation Types" section.
