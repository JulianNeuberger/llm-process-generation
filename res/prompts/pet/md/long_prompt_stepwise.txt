# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of
process relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are
spans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below.

# Mention Types

- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g., "examine", "write", "bake", "review". Do not extract, if it is information about the process itself, such as "the process ends", as this is not a task in the process! Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor, that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., "placed" in "when an order is placed". Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb as in "checked" and not "is checked"!

- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business process, e.g., "the student", "the professor", "the judge", "the clerk". It should only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract "the student" from "First the student studies for their exam". Can also be a pronoun, such as "he", "I", "she".

- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because an action produces or uses it, e.g., "the paper", "the report", "the machine part". Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like "it", but is always part of a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in "the process ends", here "process" is not Activity Data!

- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.

- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or conjunctions, e.g., "if", "otherwise", "when"

- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the gateway trigger word, e.g., "it is ready", "the claim is valid", "temperature is above 180"

- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., "while", "meanwhile", "at the same time"

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:
text	type	sentence

- **text**: the text of the mention

- **type**: the type from the ones listed above

- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

- **explanation** short explanation why you extracted this mention

# Procedure

## First Iteration

Extract mention candidates in the following order:

1. Activity
2. Actor
3. Activity Data
4. Further Specification
5. XOR Gateway
6. Condition Specification
7. AND Gateway

Make sure to reference previously extracted mentions, when extracting new ones, as there are dependencies between them: E.g., Activity Data will always appear in a sentence, that already contains an activity and the description of that activity will reference the activity data mention.

## Second Iteration

Look at the mention candidates you extracted so far. Are there candidates that do not satisfy the criteria from section "Mention Types", e.g. are there Activity Data mentions, that are not used in an Activity, or are there mentions in the given text, that are not in the list of candidates you extracted so far? If so:
Insert a new line and a divider "------", then extract a revised list of candidates, with the help of your current candidate list, and the given text. Focus on candidates where you stated, that you are not at least 90% sure in your explanation for why you extracted it. Adjust the explanation for the revised candidate. Afterwards, go to the "Second Iteration".

If you think the list of candidates is fine, and all mentions satisfy the criteria, you are done.

# Examples

## Input

Sentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .
Sentence 1: some time passes .
Sentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .

## Output

grades	Activity	0	this is a process relevant activity as it changes the object papers, I am 90% sure
passes	Activity	1	this could be a process relevant activity as it is a verb, I am 40% sure
returns	Activity	2	this is a process relevant activity as it is an active action done by the professor, I am 90% sure

the professor	Actor	0	the professor is an active participant in the process, as they are the one grading papers, I am 100% sure
the professor	Actor	2	the professor is active in the process and executes the activity "returns", I am 100% sure

all student papers	Activity Data	0	this is an Activity Data mention, as it is a real world object that is relevant in the process (handled by the professor), I am 80% sure
time	Activity Data	1	this could be an Activity Data mention, as it is a noun, but it is not relevant to the process, so i am not sure, I am 20% sure
the papers	Activity Data	2	the papers are a real world object that are returned by the professor to the students, which indicates that it is an Activity Data, I am 100% sure

------

the professor	Actor	0	the professor is an Actor, as he is executing the Activity "grading" on the Activity Data "all student papers", I am 90% sure
grades	Activity	0	this is a process relevant activity as it changes the Activity Data papers, I am 100% sure
all student papers	Activity Data	0	this is an Activity Data mention, as it is a real world object that is relevant in the process (handled by the Actor "the Professor" in Activity "grades"), i am 100% sure
the professor	Actor	2	this is an Actor, as it is the same person as in "the professor", which I already extracted, I am 100% sure
returns	Activity	2	this is an Activity, which is executed by the Actor "the professor" I already extracted, I am 100% sure
the papers	Activity Data	2	this is an Activity Data mention, as the Activity "returns", which I extracted, uses this real world object, I am 95% sure

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
