You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of
process relevant objects and data in textual descriptions of business processes.
These are spans of text, that are defined as follows:

**Activity Data**: physical or digital objects being processed, handled, or generated throughout the described business process. Pronouns can be considered Activity Data as well.

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	Activity Data	<sentence>

** Placeholders **

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

** Format Example **

The first step is to complete the report . then the clerk will review it.

the report	Activity Data	0
it	Activity Data	1

** Notes **

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
