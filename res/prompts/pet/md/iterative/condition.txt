You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of
process relevant conditions in textual descriptions of business processes.
These are spans of text, that are defined as follows:

**Condition Specification**: Description of the condition that triggers a work stream, usually following condition indicators like "if", "when".

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	Condition Specification	<sentence>

** Placeholders **

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

** Format Example **

if the report is of type A the clerk will review it for any errors . otherwise it is archived.

the report is of type A	Condition Specification	0

** Notes **

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
