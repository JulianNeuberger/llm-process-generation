# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant actors (participants) in textual descriptions of business processes. These are spans of text, that are defined below. You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.

**Actor**

Noun or Pronoun that describes a person, department, or similar role that is involved in the business process. It should only be extracted, if the current sentence contains an Activity this Actor is involved with. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract "the student" from "First the student studies for their exam".

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	Actor	<sentence>	<description>

## Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.
- <description>: short description, why this is an Actor, that actively takes part in the process.

## Format Example

The first step is to <Activity> complete </Activity> the report . then the clerk will <Activity> review </Activity> it .

the clerk	Actor	1	"the clerk" is an employee that executes the Activity "review"

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
