# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant parallel work streams (AND gateways) in textual descriptions of business processes.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.

# Definition

**AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as "in the meantime", "while", etc.

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	AND Gateway	<sentence>

## Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

## Format Example

while the clerk <activity> reviews </activity> the report for any errors it is <activity> scanned </activity> .

while	AND Gateway	0

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
