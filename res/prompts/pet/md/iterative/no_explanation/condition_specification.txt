# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant conditions in textual descriptions of business processes.
ou are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.
These are spans of text, that are defined as follows:

# Definition

**Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	Condition Specification	<sentence>

## Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

## Format Example

Sentence 0: <xor_gateway> if </xor_gateway> the report is of type A the clerk will <activity> review </activity> it for any errors .
Sentence 1: <xor_gateway> otherwise </xor_gateway> it is <activity> archived </activity> .

the report is of type A	Condition Specification	0

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
