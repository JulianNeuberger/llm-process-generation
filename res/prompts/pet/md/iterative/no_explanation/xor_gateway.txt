# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant decision points (XOR gateways) in textual descriptions of business processes.
ou are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.

# Definition

**XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying "otherwise".

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	XOR Gateway	<sentence>

## Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

## Format Example

Sentence 0: if the report is of type A the clerk will <activity> review </activity> it for any errors .
Sentence 1: otherwise it is <activity> archived </activity> .

if	XOR Gateway	0
otherwise	XOR Gateway	1

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
