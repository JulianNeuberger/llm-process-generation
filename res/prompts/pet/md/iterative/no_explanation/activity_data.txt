# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant objects and data in textual descriptions of business processes.
You are given a list of sentences, each with their own id (e.g., "Sentence 0", "Sentence 1" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.

# Definition

**Activity Data**

Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	Activity Data	<sentence>

## Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

## Format Example

The first step is to <Activity> complete </Activity> the report . then <Actor> the clerk </Actor> will <Activity> review </Activity> it.

the report	Activity Data	0
it	Activity Data	1

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation, or change the case of letters.
Do not use any code formatting.
