# Description of Task

As a specialist in business process modeling, your task is to identify mentions of process-relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are spans of text of a certain type, as described below:

# Types of Mentions

- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that actively participates in the business process, for example, "the student", "the professor", "the judge", "the clerk". It should only be extracted if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task. Include the determiner if it is present. Pronouns such as "he", "I", "she" are also considered actors.

- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, such as "examine", "write", "bake", "review". Do not extract if it pertains to information about the process itself, such as "the process ends", as this is not a task in the process. It can also be an event during the process, executed by an external, implicit actor not mentioned in the text, for example, "placed" in "when an order is placed". It never contains the actor that executes it or the activity data used during this activity; it only consists of the verb, such as "checked" and not "is checked".

- **Activity Data**: a physical object or digital data relevant to the process because an action produces or uses it, for example, "the paper", "the report", "the machine part". Always include the determiner. Pronouns like "it" are also considered activity data. It is never information about the process itself, as in "the process ends"; here, "process" is not activity data.

- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner of execution, or how an activity is executed. It follows an activity in the same sentence and describes how an activity (task) is being done.

- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or conjunctions, for example, "if", "otherwise", "when".

- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous actions performed, marked by phrases like "while", "meanwhile", "at the same time".

- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR gateway path, usually directly following the gateway trigger word, for example, "it is ready", "the claim is valid", "temperature is above 180".

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:
text	type	sentence

- **text**: the text of the mention
- **type**: the type from the ones listed above
- **sentence**: integer identifying the sentence where the mention text was found in the input, starting from zero.

## Examples of Format

*Input*:

Sentence 0: the professor grades all student papers.
Sentence 1: some time passes.
Sentence 2: then the professor returns the papers.

*Output*:

the professor	Actor	0
grades	Activity	0
all student papers	Activity Data	0
the professor	Actor	2
returns	Activity	2
the papers	Activity Data	2

# Notes

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, change spaces, or add punctuation.
Do not use any code formatting.
