# Task Description

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of
process relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are
spans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:

# Mention Types

- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business process, e.g., "the student", "the professor", "the judge", "the clerk".

- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g., "examine", "write", "bake", "review".

- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because an action produces or uses it, e.g., "the paper", "the report", "the machine part". Can also be a pronoun, like "it".

- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner of execution, or how an activity is executed. Describes how an Activity (task) is being done.

- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or conjunctions, e.g., "if", "otherwise", "when"

- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., "while", "meanwhile", "at the same time"

- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the gateway trigger word, e.g., "it is ready", "the claim is valid", "temperature is above 180"

# Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:
text	type	sentence

- **text**: the text of the mention
