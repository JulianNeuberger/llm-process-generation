# Context

You are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.

# Task Description

You are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.

## Definition of Mentions

- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in "checked" and not "is checked"!

- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.

- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract "the student" from "First the student studies for their exam".

- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is "She submits the report after a thorough review," extract "a thorough review" as Further Specification.

- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying "otherwise".

- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.

- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as "in the meantime", "while", etc.

## Procedure

Let's solve the task in 8 steps.

1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line ("-----")

2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.

3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.

4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.

5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.

6. Extract all XOR Gateways.

7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.

8. Extract all AND Gateways.

## Explanations

Additionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.

# Restrictions

## Additional considerations

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.

Do not use any code formatting.

Only extract process relevant activities.

## Disambiguation

This sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: "The process starts after the LLM has loaded."

## Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	<type>	<sentence>

### Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <type>: the type of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

### Input Example

Sentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .
Sentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.

### Output Example

extracts	Activity	0
sends	Activity	0
stores	Activity	1
all mentions	Activity Data	0
them	Activity Data	0
them	Activity Data	1
The LLM	Actor	0
the user	Actor	0
the user	Actor	1
in a file	Further Specification	1
