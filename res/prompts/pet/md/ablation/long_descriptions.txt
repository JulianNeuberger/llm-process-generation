# Task Description

You are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.

## Definition of Mentions

- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in "checked" and not "is checked"! Activities are only process relevant if they describe how something is done in a business process, e.g., how someone is informed, or how an object is handled. This includes descriptions of tasks, events, actions, etc. It is the core component of the behavioural perspective of business processes, as it constitutes the steps the process participants have to execute and are directed between.

- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data. Activity data comes in many forms, such as physical objects such as parts, printed documents, etc., or data, such as digital documents, emails, etc. Activity data is often moved between activities, created by activities, or changed by activities. In general one can say, that Activity Data is anything, physical or otherwise, that is affected in any form by an Activity.

- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract "the student" from "First the student studies for their exam". Actors can be natural persons, such as employees, workers, managers, etc., groups of persons, such as departments, companies, or organizations, etc., or they can be digital systems, such as servers, platforms, websites, databases, etc. Actors do either take active influence on the process, by acting and performing tasks, or they are passive and receive the effects of activities, such as receiving documents, mails, or are otherwise affected by the execution of activities.

- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is "She submits the report after a thorough review," extract "a thorough review" as Further Specification. These further specifications often detail, how activities have to be performed. The activity itself will tell you what is to be done, while the Further Specification will define how the task is executed, in which manner, or which additional steps have to be taken into consideration. In the example the activity "submits" tells you that something has to be submitted, while the further specification hints at the thoroughness of the review, which has to be done previously, or as an implicit prerequisite. This can can of course also be something like "via mail", to specify, that the "submit" task has to be done digitally.

- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying "otherwise". Often these decision points are explained over several sentences, this is why you may find XOR_gateway, that refer to each other and describe a similar decision.

- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any. While the XOR Gateway defines where in the process a decision may occur, the condition specification defines what has to test true, so that the specific path can be taken. This can be something like a certain temperature being over a threshold, an error that may occur and triggers a process path, that corrects the error, or something of that capacity.

- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as "in the meantime", "while", etc. And Gateways define workflows that can be executed in parallel, such as when multiple departments work on different projects, or a customer can be informed about changes in their order, while an employee executes the changes in parallel. And gateways are often implicit and are only interesting for us, if they are described explicitly.

## Procedure

Let's solve the task in 8 steps.

1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line ("-----")

2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.

3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.

4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.

5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.

6. Extract all XOR Gateways.

7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.

8. Extract all AND Gateways.

## Explanations

Additionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.

# Restrictions

## Additional considerations

Do not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.

Do not use any code formatting.

Only extract process relevant activities.

## Disambiguation

This sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: "The process starts after the LLM has loaded."

## Format

For each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:

<text>	<type>	<sentence>

### Placeholders

- <text>: the text of the mention
- <type>: the type of the mention
- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.

### Input Example

Sentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .
Sentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.

### Output Example

extracts	Activity	0
sends	Activity	0
stores	Activity	1
all mentions	Activity Data	0
them	Activity Data	0
them	Activity Data	1
The LLM	Actor	0
the user	Actor	0
the user	Actor	1
in a file	Further Specification	1
