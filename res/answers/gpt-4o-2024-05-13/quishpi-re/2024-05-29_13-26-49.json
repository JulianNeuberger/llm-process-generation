All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any

in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action.

identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply.

business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2.

To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id>

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id>

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id>

modelling expert, tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

process modelling expert, tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action.

Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any

descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details).

Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply.

All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply.

Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1.

Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any

tasked with identifying\nconstraints between actions in textual process descriptions. Processes consist of actions and, thus, textual process\ndescriptions are sentences that describe a short sequence of actions. Ordering and existence of actions depend on\nconstraints between them. Below you find further definitions for ACTIONS and CONSTRAINTS:\n\n- ACTIONS (Def.): predicate and object describing a task. Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is\n          some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- CONSTRAINTS (Def.): defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head\n              action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. All\n              constraints are one of the following types:\n    - init: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init\n    constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started\n    for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - end: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no\n            no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended\n    for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n    - precedence: The tail action can only be executed, if the head was already executed\n                  before. the head may be executed without the tail being executed.\n    - response: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too.\n    - succession: this means if the head activity is executed, the tail activity needs to be\n          executed as well and at the same time, the tail activity requires prior execution of the head activity.\n    - existence: requires that an action is executed at some point in the process; the execution is not dependent on\n        any other explicitly mentioned action; there is only a head action but no tail action.\n    - absence: requires that an action is NOT executed at any time in the process; the absence is not dependent on\n        any other action but other circumstances (e.g., information from the process context); there is only a head\n        action but no tail action; Note: negated absence constraint is semantically equivalent to an existence\n        constraint.\n    - noncooccurrence: requires the head action is not executed if the tail action is executed and vice versa.\n\nAdditionally, you can determine if the given document describes a negation of constraints,\ne.g., \"when something happens, then we DO something\" describes a positive constraint,\nwhile \"when something happens, then we DON'T DO something\" describes a negation.\n\nLet's carry out your task STEPWISE:\n1. First, identify actions contained in the input sentence (a description how you can identify actions is given in\nACTIONS (Def.) above).\n2. Insert the following character sequence in the output: '#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'\n3. Generate constraints based on the constraint types above (see CONSTRAINTS (Def.) for details). To do this, only use\nthe actions that you defined before the mark ('#-#-#RESULT#-#-#'). The format MUST be as follows:\n    Please extract all constraints in the given raw text in the following format:\n    Print one constraint per line, where you separate if the constraint is negative (TRUE if\n    the document describes a negation, else it reads FALSE), the type of the constraint, and the\n    extracted actions by tabs in the following form (<...> are placeholders; <sentence id> is always 0, if a tail action exists depends on the constraint):\n    <sentence id>\t<TRUE or FALSE>\t<constraint type>\t<head action>\t<tail action>.\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any
