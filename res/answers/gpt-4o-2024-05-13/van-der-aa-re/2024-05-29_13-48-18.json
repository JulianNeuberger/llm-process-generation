Predicate is usually a transitive verb, and object is some physical or digital object on which is being acted on.\n\n- ** CONSTRAINT **: defines if and how actions can be executed. Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended for an end constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** precedence **: if the head action is executed the tail action CAN be executed as well. Thus, the head action is a precondition for executing the tail action.\n\n- ** response **: if the head action was executed, the tail action has to be executed, too. Thus, executing the tail action is mandatory in this case.\n\n- ** succession **: combination of **precedence** and **response**. The tail action cannot be executed before the head action, but once the head action has been executed, it is mandatory to also execute the tail action.\n\n## Negation\n\nAdditionally, you may encounter negative constraints, indicated by statements like \"do not\" or \"must not.\" Negations invert the restriction of the tail activity. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.\n\n# Disambiguation\n\nThe constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint. Thus, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.\nHowever, if you recognize an action in a sentence and there is no other action, it is NEVER a Precedence, Response or Succession constraint.\nThe following abstract examples illustrate the differences:\n\n- Example 1: If action A is performed, action B is carried out.

Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

The tail action cannot be executed before the head action, but once the head action has been executed, it is mandatory to also execute the tail action.\n\n## Negation\n\nAdditionally, you may encounter negative constraints, indicated by statements like \"do not\" or \"must not.\" Negations invert the restriction of the tail activity. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.\n\n# Disambiguation\n\nThe constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint. Thus, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.\nHowever, if you recognize an action in a sentence and there is no other action, it is NEVER a Precedence, Response or Succession constraint.\nThe following abstract examples illustrate the differences:\n\n- Example 1: If action A is performed, action B is carried out.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response).

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.\n\n# Disambiguation\n\nThe constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response).

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action.

Always has a source / head action and sometimes a target / tail action, depending on the type. If a constraint has a head action, the tail action is restricted in a way defined by the type.\n\n## Constraint Types\n\n- ** init **: marks an action as the start of an entire process. This action is the source / head action of the init constraint. There is no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is started for an init constraint to apply. Signal words alone are not sufficient here.\n\n- ** end **: marks an action as the end of the whole process. The action is the source / head action. There is no no target / tail action. Note that it must be explicitly stated that the PROCESS is ended for an end constraint to apply.

Thus, executing the tail action is mandatory in this case.\n\n- ** succession **: combination of **precedence** and **response**. The tail action cannot be executed before the head action, but once the head action has been executed, it is mandatory to also execute the tail action.\n\n## Negation\n\nAdditionally, you may encounter negative constraints, indicated by statements like \"do not\" or \"must not.\" Negations invert the restriction of the tail activity. A negation is NOT a constraint type itself.\n\n# Disambiguation\n\nThe constraints precedence, response and succession are easy to confuse. To differentiate between Response and Precedence, carefully analyze whether the tail action CAN be performed\nbecause the head action has already been performed (Precedence), or whether the tail action MUST THEREFORE be performed (Response). If BOTH is true, it is a Succession constraint. Thus, modal verbs play an important role for disambiguating constraints.\nHowever, if you recognize an action in a sentence and there is no other action, it is NEVER a Precedence, Response or Succession constraint.\nThe following abstract examples illustrate the differences:\n\n- Example 1: If action A is performed, action B is carried out.
