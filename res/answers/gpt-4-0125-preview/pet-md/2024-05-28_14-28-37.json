continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by <actor> the customer </actor> is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can <activity> speed up </activity> <activity_data> the switch process </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> <activity_data> the power meter data </activity_data> to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption
