If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action.

This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends.\n\nThe trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii).\n\nCustomer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report.\n\nThen, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing.\n\nThe report for the customer is sent out to her.\n\nAfter all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service.\n\nAfter the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.\n\nElements: mentions\nAI:"

Information about the process itself, such as \"the process starts\" do not constitute an action and should not be extracted.\n\n- **condition**: a phrase (span of text) that declares a decision and starts a conditional path in the process, usually the part directly following conditionals, adverbs, etc. The condition does not include the trigger word itself. If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action. Actions that are mutually exclusive (usually indicated by phrases like \"or\", \"either\") are also marked as two separate Condition elements.\n\n** Format **\n\nPlease extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:\nPrint one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type, its text, and a short explanation why you extracted it, by tabs, e.g. \"action\tdo something\tthis is an active task in the process\".\n\n<type>\t<text>\t<explanation>\n\n** Format Example **\n\nThe LLM annotates a span of natural language text, if it is a relevant element, or skips it. then it returns it, after it formatted it correctly.\n\naction\tannotates\taction a process participant (the LLM) executes, which is process relevant, as it describes a task\ncondition\tit is a relevant element\tthis statement follows a conditional \"if\" and explains the condition\ncondition\tskips\tthis is not an action, as it is mutually exclusive with the previous condition \"it is a relevant element\", there for it is a condition as well\naction\treturns\taction a process participant (the LLM) does, relevant to the process\naction\tformatted\taction a process participant (the LLM) did, which is still relevant to the process, as it was done after \"annotates\" and before \"returns\"\n\n** Notes **\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any code formatting.

For each new assignment, it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required.\n\nThis information is added to the assignment list.\n\nThe secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system.\n\nIt passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient.\n\nAn intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office.\n\nFor each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file.\n\nAs soon as this copy is received, the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file. The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible.\n\nDuring the first meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out.\n\nAdditional observations are registered in a personal notebook.\n\nAfter a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient.\n\nThe standard checklist is also added to the patient\u2019s file.\n\nThe second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received.\n\nPhysicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the information is added to the patient file.\n\nAs soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status.\n\nFor the staff meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients.\n\nFor each of these patients, the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan.\n\nThis treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure.\n\nElements: mentions\nAI:"

If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action.
