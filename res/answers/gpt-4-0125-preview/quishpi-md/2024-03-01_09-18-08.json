These process descriptions are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions  conditional. More details on actions and conditions:\n\n** Definition **\n\n- **action**: the task a participant of the process has to execute, or a task that affects a process participant, a single verb that defines a unit of work.

Information about the process itself, such as \"the process starts\" do not constitute an action and should not be extracted.\n\n- **condition**: a phrase (span of text) that declares a decision and starts a conditional path in the process, usually the part directly following conditionals, adverbs, etc. The condition does not include the trigger word itself. If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action. Actions that are mutually exclusive (usually indicated by phrases like \"or\", \"either\") are also marked as *two* separate Condition elements, and the trigger word (e.g., \"or\") is not included.\n\n** Format **\n\nPlease extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:\nPrint one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type, and its text by tabs, e.g. \"action\tdo something\".\n\n<type>\t<text>\n\n** Format Example **\n\naction\tannotate\ncondition\tit is a relevant element\naction\tformatted\n\n** Notes **\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any code formatting.

For each new assignment, it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required.\n\nThis information is added to the assignment list.\n\nThe secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system.\n\nIt passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient.\n\nAn intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office.\n\nFor each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file.\n\nAs soon as this copy is received, the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file. The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible.\n\nDuring the first meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out.\n\nAdditional observations are registered in a personal notebook.\n\nAfter a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient.\n\nThe standard checklist is also added to the patient\u2019s file.\n\nThe second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received.\n\nPhysicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the information is added to the patient file.\n\nAs soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status.\n\nFor the staff meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients.\n\nFor each of these patients, the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan.\n\nThis treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure.\n\n        Elements: ['mentions']\n\n        AI: condition\tthe medical file of the patient is required\ncondition\tnew patients\naction\trequesting\naction\tregistered\naction\tnot leave\naction\tassigning\naction\tformulate\naction\tinquires\naction\trecorded\naction\tassigned\naction\trequired\naction\tprepares\naction\texamined\naction\trecorded\naction\treceived\naction\tprinted\naction\tcreated\naction\tstored\naction\tstores\naction\trecord\naction\tstored\naction\thanded\naction\tsends\naction\tadded\naction\tadded\naction\tmakes\naction\tprint\naction\tadded\naction\tplans\naction\tplans\naction\tkept\naction\tends\naction\tput\naction\tadd\n\nUser: Please retrieve all ['mentions'] from the following text: \n        Text: The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released.\n\nThe Client Service Back Office as part of the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file.\n\nThen, the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police.\n\nThe SCT physical file is stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to be sent by the Police.\n\nWhen the report is received, the respective SCT file is retrieved.\n\nThen, Back Office attaches the new SCT document, and stores the expanded SCT physical file.\n\nAfter that, some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file (out of scope).\n\n        Elements: ['mentions']\n\n        AI: action\tretrieves\naction\tforwarded\naction\tretrieved\naction\tattaches\naction\treceives\naction\trequest\naction\tstored\naction\tstores\n\nUser: Please retrieve all ['mentions'] from the following text: \n        Text: The process starts by reviewing the order.\nThe staff should check if all the requested items are available.\nIf something is missing, the staff has to inform customer about a potential delay and order the missing products.\nIn the exceptional case of a discontinued item, the customer should be informed about the not longer available items.\nAfter waiting an average of x days for the delivery, the staff should check again if all products are on store.\nIf everything is OK, then the staff recollects all products and prepare a package.\nThe courier is then informed about the pre-processed package.\nThe courier company informs the client about a potential delay until there are enough human resources to process the delivery.\nThen, the package is picked up by the designed driver.\nA centralized service decides the best route to deliver all driver's packages.\nOnce the driver delivers the package, she should update the system so all stakeholders are notified.\n\n        Elements: ['mentions']\n\n        AI: condition\tenough human resources to process the delivery\ncondition\tsomething is missing\ncondition\teverything is OK\naction\trecollects\naction\treviewing\naction\tpicked up\naction\tinformed\naction\tinformed\naction\tdelivers\naction\tprepare\naction\tdecides\naction\tinforms\naction\tinform\naction\tupdate\naction\tcheck\naction\torder\n\nUser: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text: \nText: A small company manufactures customized bicycles.\n\nWhenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created.\n\nA member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike.\n\nIn the former case, the process instance is finished.\n\nIn the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed.\n\nThe storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part.\n\nIf the part is available in-house, it is reserved.\n\nIf it is not available, it is back-ordered.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.\n\nIn the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.\n\nIf the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.\n\nAfterwards, the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.\n\nElements: mentions\nAI:"

of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship.\n\nIn case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here).\n\nIn case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to

detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management.\n\nService Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers.\n\nAfter receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning.\n\nIn case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning.\n\nIf Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they

Provisioning and a trouble report is created.\n\nEither trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management.\n\nService Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information.\n\nSubsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report.\n\nThree alternative process paths may be taken.\n\nFor the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service.\n\nFor

If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action.

customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are.\n\nBased on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities.\n\nAn electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship.\n\nIn case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here).\n\nIn case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues.\n\nTaking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is created.\n\nThe detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management.\n\nService Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers.\n\nAfter receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning.\n\nIn case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning.\n\nIf Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem.\n\nAfter Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems.\n\nIf no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created.\n\nIf a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created.\n\nEither trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management.\n\nService Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information.\n\nSubsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report.\n\nThree alternative process paths may be taken.\n\nFor the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service.\n\nFor the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves.\n\nSubsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service.\n\nAfter sending, this process path of Service Management ends.\n\nFor the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration.\n\nThis message is then sent to Resource Provisioning.\n\nResource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process.\n\nAfter the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked.\n\nBased on the tracked errors, all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning.\n\nThen a trouble-shooting report is created. This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends.\n\nThe trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii).\n\nCustomer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report.\n\nThen, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing.\n\nThe report for the customer is sent out to her.\n\nAfter all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service.\n\nAfter the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.\n\nElements: mentions\nAI:"

          "** Background **\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with finding actions and conditions in textual business process descriptions. These process descriptions are natural language texts that define how a business process has to be executed, with actions that have to be taken and conditions, that make the execution of some actions  conditional. More details on actions and conditions:\n\n** Definition **\n\n- **action**: the task a participant of the process has to execute, or a task that affects a process participant, a single verb that defines a unit of work. Should not include the object the work is executed on / with, nor the participant that executes the action, nor additional specifications, like adjectives or adverbs. Information about the process itself, such as \"the process starts\" do not constitute an action and should not be extracted.\n\n- **condition**: a phrase (span of text) that declares a decision and starts a conditional path in the process, usually the part directly following conditionals, adverbs, etc. The condition does not include the trigger word itself. If the condition does consist only of the trigger word, do not extract it. Only extract, if the condition affects an earlier or following action. Actions that are mutually exclusive (usually indicated by phrases like \"or\", \"either\") are also marked as *two* separate Condition elements, and the trigger word (e.g., \"or\") is not included.\n\n** Format **\n\nPlease extract all mentions in the given raw text in the following format:\nPrint one mention per line, where you separate the mentions type, and its text by tabs, e.g. \"action\tdo something\".\n\n<type>\t<text>\n\n** Format Example **\n\naction\tannotate\ncondition\tit is a relevant element\naction\tformatted\n\n** Notes **\n\nPlease return raw text, do not use any code formatting.
