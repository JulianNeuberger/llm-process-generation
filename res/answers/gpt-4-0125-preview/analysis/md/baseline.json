          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .\nSentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.\n\n### Output Example\n\nextracts\tActivity\t0\nsends\tActivity\t0\nstores\tActivity\t1\nall mentions\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t1\nThe LLM\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t1\nin a file\tFurther Specification\t1\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: After a claim is registered , it is examined by a claims officer .\nSentence 1: The claims officer then writes a settlement recommendation .\nSentence 2: This recommendation is then checked by a senior claims officer who may mark the claim as OK or Not OK .\nSentence 3: If the claim is marked as Not OK , it is sent back to the claims officer and the recommendation is repeated .\nSentence 4: If the claim is OK , the claim handling process proceeds .\n\n"

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .\nSentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.\n\n### Output Example\n\nextracts\tActivity\t0\nsends\tActivity\t0\nstores\tActivity\t1\nall mentions\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t1\nThe LLM\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t1\nin a file\tFurther Specification\t1\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: Mail from the party is collected on a daily basis by the Mail Processing Unit .\nSentence 1: Within this unit , the Mail Clerk sorts the unopened mail into the various business areas .\nSentence 2: The mail is then distributed .\nSentence 3: When the mail is received by the Registry , it is opened and sorted into groups for distribution , and thus registered in a manual incoming Mail Register .\nSentence 4: Afterwards , the Assistant Registry Manager within the Registry performs a quality check .\nSentence 5: If the mail is not compliant , a list of requisition explaining the reason for rejection is compiled and sent back to the party .\nSentence 6: Otherwise , the matter details ( types of action ) are captured and provided to the Cashier , who takes the applicable fees attached to the mail .\nSentence 7: At this point , the Assistant Registry Manager puts the receipt and copied documents into an envelope and posts it to the party .\nSentence 8: Meantime , the Cashier captures the Party Details and prints the Physical Court File .\n\n"

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity.

Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

the secretarial office of the mental health care institute .\nSentence 1: This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment .\nSentence 2: The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient .\nSentence 3: On the basis of this information , the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in .\nSentence 4: The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental , health , and social state of the patient in question .\nSentence 5: This information is recorded on a registration form .\nSentence 6: At the end of the conversation , this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute .\nSentence 7: Here , the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed .\nSentence 8: For new patients , a patient file is created .\nSentence 9: The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file .\nSentence 10: Patient files are kept at the secretarial office and may not leave the building .\nSentence 11: At the secretarial office , two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient .\nSentence 12: The registration card contains a set of basic patient data .\nSentence 13: The new patient is added on the list of new notices .\nSentence 14: Halfway the week , at Wednesday , a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place .\nSentence 15: The medical team consists of social-medical workers , physicians , and a psychiatrist .\nSentence 16: At this meeting , the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team .\nSentence 17: Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker , who will act as the first intaker of the patient .\nSentence 18: One of the physicians will act as the second intaker .\nSentence 19: In assigning intakers , the teamleader takes into account their expertise , the region they are responsible for , earlier contacts they might have had with the patient , and their case load .\nSentence 20: The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office .\nSentence 21: For each new assignment , it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required .\nSentence 22: This information is added to the assignment list .\nSentence 23: The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system .\nSentence 24: It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient .\nSentence 25: An intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office .\nSentence 26: For each patient for which the medical file is required , the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient , requesting for a copy of the medical file .\nSentence 27: As soon as this copy is received , the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file .\nSentence 28: The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible .\nSentence 29: During the first meeting , the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out .\nSentence 30: Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook .\nSentence 31: After a visit , the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient .\nSentence 32: The standard checklist is also added to the patient's file .\nSentence 33: The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received .\nSentence 34: Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients .\nSentence 35: The secretarial office types out these tapes , after which the information is added to the patient file .\nSentence 36: As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place , the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status .\nSentence 37: For the staff meeting on Wednesday , they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients .\nSentence 38: For each of these patients , the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan .\nSentence 39: This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure .\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .\nSentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.\n\n### Output Example\n\nextracts\tActivity\t0\nsends\tActivity\t0\nstores\tActivity\t1\nall mentions\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t1\nThe LLM\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t1\nin a file\tFurther Specification\t1\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: The MPON notifies the MPOO about equipment change intentions .\nSentence 1: The MPOO announces self dismounting to the MPON or the MPOO shall notify the MPON about no self-dismounting of the MPOO .\nSentence 2: The MPON or the MPOO perform the final reading .\nSentence 3: The MPON or the MPOO dismount the old equipment .\nSentence 4: The MPON mounts the new device .\nSentence 5: The MPON reads the meter count from the installed meter .\nSentence 6: The MPON sents the values of the final reading to the GO .\nSentence 7: The MPON tells the GO about the device changes , the master data and the meter count at installation .\nSentence 8: The GO shall notify the MSP about the device changes , the master data , the meter count at dismounting , and the meter count at installation .\n\n"

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7. Reference the XOR Gateways you found and look for the condition that belongs to the gateway, extract it.\n\n8. Extract all AND Gateways.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, to each mention you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\n\nDo not use any code formatting.\n\nOnly extract process relevant activities.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nThis sentence does not contain an Activity mention, because the verb describes meta information about the process: \"The process starts after the LLM has loaded.\"\n\n## Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\t<type>\t<sentence>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <type>: the type of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: The LLM extracts all mentions and sends them to the user .\nSentence 1: Then the user stores them in a file.\n\n### Output Example\n\nextracts\tActivity\t0\nsends\tActivity\t0\nstores\tActivity\t1\nall mentions\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t0\nthem\tActivity Data\t1\nThe LLM\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t0\nthe user\tActor\t1\nin a file\tFurther Specification\t1\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: The MSPN registers the measurement at the GO .\nSentence 1: The GO examines the application of the MSPN .\nSentence 2: The GO rejects the application of the MSPN or the GO confirmes the application of the MSPN .\nSentence 3: The GO assigns the MSPN .\nSentence 4: The GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of MSPN .\nSentence 5: The GO informs the MPO about the assignment of the MSPN .\nSentence 6: The GO informs the SP about the assignment of MSPN .\n\n"
