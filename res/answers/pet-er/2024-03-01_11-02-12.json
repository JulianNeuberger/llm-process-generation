In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , <activity_data id=33> the detailed problem report </activity_data> is sent out to <actor id=55> Resource Provisioning </actor> . If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , <actor id=46> they </actor> perform <activity_data id=63> the analysis </activity_data> and based on the outcome <actor id=45> they </actor> create <activity_data id=65> a trouble report </activity_data> that indicates the type of problem . After <actor id=59> Resource Provisioning </actor> receives <activity_data id=32> the detailed problem report </activity_data> , <activity_data id=69> it </activity_data> is checked whether there are any possible problems . If no problems are detected , <activity_data id=73> a notification </activity_data> about the normal service execution is created . If a problem is detected <activity_data id=77> this </activity_data> will be analyzed by <actor id=58> Resource Provisioning </actor> and <activity_data id=66> a trouble report </activity_data> is created . Either <activity_data id=67> trouble report </activity_data> or <activity_data id=80> the normal execution notification </activity_data> will be included in a status report and sent back to <actor id=42> Service Management </actor> . <actor id=41> Service Management </actor> then prepares <activity_data id=84> the final status report </activity_data> based on the received information . Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report . Three alternative process paths may be taken . For the case that no problem was detected at all , <activity_data id=87> the actual service performance </activity_data> is sent back to <actor id=7> the Customer Service </actor> . For the case that minor corrective actions are required , <actor id=40> Service Management </actor> will undertake <activity_data id=92> corrective actions </activity_data> by themselves . Subsequently , <activity_data id=93> the problem resolution report </activity_data> is created and then sent out to <actor id=10> Customer Service </actor> . After sending , this process path of Service Management ends . For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , <actor id=39> Service Management </actor> must create <activity_data id=101> a request </activity_data> for automatic resource restoration . <activity_data id=103> This message </activity_data> is then sent to <actor id=57> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process . After <activity_data id=102> the restoration request </activity_data> is received , <activity_data id=106> all possible errors </activity_data> are tracked . Based on the tracked errors , all necessary <activity_data id=108> corrective actions </activity_data> are undertaken by <actor id=56> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Then <activity_data id=110> a trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is created . <activity_data id=111> This report </activity_data> is sent out to <actor id=38> Service Management </actor> ; then the process ends . <activity_data id=112> The trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is received by <actor id=37> Service Management </actor> and this information goes then into the creation of <activity_data id=95> the problem resolution report </activity_data> just as described for ii ) . <actor id=9> Customer Service </actor> either receives <activity_data id=118> the actual service performance </activity_data> ( if there was no problem ) or <activity_data id=94> the problem resolution report </activity_data> . Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) <activity_data id=128> a report </activity_data> is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) <activity_data id=121> an SLA violation rebate </activity_data> is reported to <actor id=123> Billing & Collections </actor> <actor id=124> who </actor> will adjust <activity_data id=126> the billing </activity_data> . <activity_data id=127> The report </activity_data> for the customer is sent out to <actor id=132> her </actor> . After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service . After <actor id=131> the customer </actor> then receives <activity_data id=129> the report </activity_data> about service performance and problem resolution from <actor id=8> Customer Service </actor> , the process flow at the customer also ends .\nElements: entities\nAI:"], "steps": [["entities"]], "formatters": ["PetEntityListingFormattingStrategy"], "input_tokens": 1871, "output_tokens": 115, "total_costs": 0.02216, "answers": ["13 14 30 31 33 32\n51 50\n65 66 67\n73 80\n84 112\n87 118\n92 108\n93 95 94\n101 102\n103 111\n128 127 129\n126 121\n133 131 132\n6 7 10 9\n11 21 36 43 44 40 39 38 37 41 42 46 45 55 59 58 57 56 123 124"], "original_id": "doc-2.1"}]}, {"meta": {"num_shots": 0, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "temperature": 0.0}, "results": [{"prompts": ["** Task **\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying which mentions of certain process relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes belong to the same entity.

In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , <activity_data id=27> a new customer object </activity_data> is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow . This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare <activity_data id=30> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated check of <activity_data id=32> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor id=34> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data id=38> the causing issues </activity_data> are being analyzed and resolved . Subsequently <activity_data id=31> the contract documents </activity_data> are generated once again . In case of a positive response <activity_data id=44> a confirmation document </activity_data> is sent out to <actor id=2> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed . <activity_data id=46> A request </activity_data> to <actor id=48> the grid operator </actor> is automatically sent out by <actor id=35> the CIS </actor> . It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future . <activity_data id=47> The switch-over request </activity_data> is checked by <actor id=53> the grid operator </actor> for supplier concurrence , and <actor id=52> the grid operator </actor> transmits <activity_data id=58> a response comment </activity_data> . In the case of supplier concurrence <actor id=51> the grid operator </actor> would inform <actor id=62> all involved suppliers </actor> and demand <activity_data id=64> the resolution of the conflict </activity_data> . <actor id=54> The grid operator </actor> communicates with <actor id=66> the old supplier </actor> and carries out <activity_data id=71> the termination of the sales agreement </activity_data> between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) . If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor id=10> customer service </actor> creates <activity_data id=75> a CIS contract </activity_data> . <actor id=3> The customer </actor> then has the chance to check <activity_data id=79> the contract details </activity_data> and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from <activity_data id=76> the switch contract </activity_data> or confirm <activity_data id=77> it </activity_data> . Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) . An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor id=50> the grid operator </actor> transmits <activity_data id=85> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor id=12> the customer service </actor> and <actor id=69> the old supplier </actor> via messages containing a services consumption report . At the same time , <actor id=49> the grid operator </actor> computes <activity_data id=91> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and sends <activity_data id=92> it </activity_data> to <actor id=68> the old supplier </actor> . Likewise <actor id=67> the old supplier </actor> creates and sends <activity_data id=93> the final billing </activity_data> to <actor id=1> the customer </actor> . For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After receiving <activity_data id=86> the meter data </activity_data> <actor id=9> customer service </actor> imports <activity_data id=87> the meter data </activity_data> to systems that require the information . The process of winning a new customer ends here .\nElements: entities\nAI:"], "steps": [["entities"]], "formatters": ["PetEntityListingFormattingStrategy"], "input_tokens": 1586, "output_tokens": 95, "total_costs": 0.018710000000000004, "answers": ["5 6 14 7 27 30 32 31 44 38 46 47 58 64 71 75 79 76 77 85 86 87 91 92 93\n0 2 3 8 11 34 35 48 53 52 51 62 54 66 10 12 69 50 49 68 67 1 9"], "original_id": "doc-2.2"}]}, {"meta": {"num_shots": 0, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "temperature": 0.0}, "results": [{"prompts": ["** Task **\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying which mentions of certain process relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes belong to the same entity.
