Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity. Spot descriptions, where Activities can be executed in parallel, usually identifiable by phrases such as \"in the meantime\", \"while\", etc.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve the task in 8 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3.

service has degraded .\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n"], "steps": [["mentions"]], "formatter_args": [{"only_tags": null, "generate_descriptions": false,

.\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n"],

Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all mentions of activities and extract them.\n\n3. Reference the activities you found and extract all mentions of Activity Data.\n\n4. Reference the activities you found so far and check, if there is an Actor that performs the activity or is affected by it. Extract any you find.\n\n5. Reference the activities you found and look for further specification on how to execute the activity. Extract the ones you find.\n\n6. Extract all XOR Gateways.\n\n7.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description.\n\n## Definition of Mentions\n\n- **Activity**: Focus on verbs and nouns, that describe an active task or action executed during the business process. Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this Activity, is just the verb or noun as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: Look for Activity mentions in the text, and find the grammatical object that this Activity acts upon. Extract it (including any determiners, if present) as an Activity Data.\n\n- **Actor**: Focus at Activity mentions in the given text. Extract the person, department, or similar role that executes the Activity or is directly affected by the activity. Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the student studies for their exam\".\n\n- **Further Specification**: Look for mentions of type Activity and extract descriptions of **how** this Activity is being executed, including means, and manner. Example: If the sentence is \"She submits the report after a thorough review,\" extract \"a thorough review\" as Further Specification.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n- **Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n- **AND Gateway**: Focus on mentions of type Activity.
