It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner!

Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

Description\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner!

and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee .\nSentence 2: In `` ACME Financial Accounting `` , a software specially developed for the ACME AG , she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance ( invoice ) .\nSentence 3: She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form ( `` docket `` ) .\nSentence 4: The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list .\nSentence 5: He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice .\nSentence 6: Should everything be in order , he notes his code one on the docket ( `` accurate position - AP `` ) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail .\nSentence 7: From it , the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager , based on the docket , or if all items are marked correct , sent back to accounting .\nSentence 8: Therefore , the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate .\nSentence 9: However , if inconsistencies exist , e.g . because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality , the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket , and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly .\nSentence 10: Based on the statements of the cost center managers , she will proceede with the clarification with the vendor , but , if necessary , she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again .\nSentence 11: When all inconsistencies are resolved , the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again , and the process continues .\nSentence 12: After all invoice items are AP , the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager .\nSentence 13: He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment .\nSentence 14: If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20 , the Board wants to check it again ( 4 - eyes-principle ) .\nSentence 15: The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file .\nSentence 16: Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit , it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier .\nSentence 17: After the commercial audit is successfully completed , the accounting employee gives payment

expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\nDo not use any code formatting.\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded .\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends

expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\nDo not use any code formatting.\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: The MPON reports the meter operation to the GO .\nSentence 1: The GO examines the application of the MPON .\nSentence 2: The GO rejects the application of the MPON or the GO confirmes the application of the MPON .\nSentence 3: The GO informs the MPOO about the registration confirmation of the MPON .\nSentence 4: The GO informs the MSPO about the registration confirmation of the MPON .\nSentence 5: The MPON and the MPOO perform the equipment acquisition and / or equipment changes .\nSentence 6: The MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process or the MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the entire process .\nSentence 7: The GO informs the MPON about the failure of the overall transaction by deadline if after a maximum time limit no message of the MPON is present at the GO .\nSentence 8: If the MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process , the GO confirms the failure of the assignment to the MPON .\nSentence 9: If the MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the overall process , the GO assigns the MPON .\nSentence 10: The GO confirms the assignment to the MPON .\nSentence 11: The GO informs the MPOO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON or the GO informs the MPOO about the assignment of the MPON .\nSentence 12: The GO informs the MSPO about the failure of the assignment of the MPON or the GO informs the MSPO about the assignment of the MPON .\nSentence 13: The GO informs the SP about the assignment of the MPON .\n\n\nAI: \nThe MPON\tactor\t0\t\nThe MPON\tactor\t6\t\nThe MPON\tactor\t5\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t10\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t9\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t8\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t7\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t6\t\nthe MPON\tactor\t1\t\nreports\tactivity\t0\t\nthe meter operation\tactivity data\t0\t\nThe GO\tactor\t1\t\nthe GO\tactor\t12\t\nthe GO\tactor\t11\t\nthe GO\tactor\t9\t\nthe GO\tactor\t8\t\nthe GO\tactor\t6\t\nthe GO\tactor\t6\t\nthe GO\tactor\t2\t\nthe GO\tactor\t0\t\nThe GO\tactor\t13\t\nThe GO\tactor\t12\t\nThe GO\tactor\t11\t\nThe GO\tactor\t10\t\nThe GO\tactor\t7\t\nThe GO\tactor\t4\t\nThe GO\tactor\t3\t\nThe GO\tactor\t2\t\nexamines\tactivity\t1\t\nrejects\tactivity\t2\t\nthe application of the MPON\tactivity data\t2\t\nthe application\tactivity data\t1\t\nthe application of the MPON\tactivity data\t2\t\nor\txor gateway\t2\t\nconfirmes\tactivity\t2\t\ninforms\tactivity\t3\t\nthe MPOO\tactor\t3\t\nthe MPOO\tactor\t11\t\nthe MPOO\tactor\t11\t\nthe MPOO\tactor\t5\t\nabout the registration confirmation of the MPON\tactivity data\t3\t\nabout the registration confirmation of the MPON\tactivity data\t4\t\ninforms\tactivity\t4\t\nthe MSPO\tactor\t4\t\nthe MSPO\tactor\t12\t\nthe MSPO\tactor\t12\t\nperform\tactivity\t5\t\nthe equipment acquisition and / or equipment changes\tactivity data\t5\t\ninforms\tactivity\t6\t\nabout the failure of the entire process\tactivity data\t6\t\nor\txor gateway\t6\t\ninforms\tactivity\t6\t\nabout the successful completion of the entire process\tactivity data\t6\t\ninforms\tactivity\t7\t\nabout the failure of the overall transaction by deadline\tactivity data\t7\t\nif\txor gateway\t7\t\nafter a maximum time limit no message of the MPON is present at the GO\tcondition specification\t7\t\nIf\txor gateway\t8\t\nthe MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process\tcondition specification\t8\t\nconfirms\tactivity\t8\t\nthe failure of the assignment\tactivity data\t8\t\nIf\txor gateway\t9\t\nthe MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the overall process\tcondition specification\t9\t\nassigns\tactivity\t9\t\nconfirms\tactivity\t10\t\nthe assignment\tactivity data\t10\t\ninforms\tactivity\t11\t\nabout the failure of the assignment of the MPON\tactivity data\t11\t\ninforms\tactivity\t11\t\nabout the assignment of the MPON\tactivity data\t11\t\ninforms\tactivity\t12\t\nabout the failure of the assignment of the MPON\tactivity data\t12\t\ninforms\tactivity\t12\t\nabout the assignment of the MPON\tactivity data\t12\t\ninforms\tactivity\t13\t\nthe SP\tactor\t13\t\nabout the assignment of the MPON\tactivity data\t13\t\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: The INQ transmits the transaction data request to the IP .\nSentence 1: The IP checks the request of the INQ .\nSentence 2: The IP answers the question of the INQ depending on the outcome of the examination , i.e .

1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\nAI: \nAt\tactivity data\t0\t\nperceives\tactivity\t0\t\nher subscribed service\tactivity data\t0\t\nhas

mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description.

Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

customer service department of the company .\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\nAI: \nthe customer\tactor\t1\t\nthe

financial midwives to a new issue .\nSentence 2: Usually they play a triple role : First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice , then they buy the issue , and finally they resell it to the public .\nSentence 3: Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly .\nSentence 4: Thus , in addition to handling the sale of a company \u2019 s issue , the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it .\nSentence 5: They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .\nSentence 6: In addition to registering the issue with the SEC , they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state .\nSentence 7: While the registration statement is awaiting approval , underwriters begin to firm up the issue price .\nSentence 8: They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors .\nSentence 9: Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC , underwriters fix the issue price .\nSentence 10: After that they enter into a

Description\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\nAI: \nAt\tactivity data\t0\t\nperceives\tactivity\t0\t\nher subscribed service\tactivity data\t0\t\nhas degraded\tfurther specification\t0\t\nA list with all the

are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee .\nSentence 2: In `` ACME Financial Accounting `` , a software specially developed for the ACME AG , she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance ( invoice ) .\nSentence 3: She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form ( `` docket `` ) .\nSentence 4: The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list .\nSentence 5: He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice .\nSentence 6: Should everything be in order , he notes his code one on the docket ( `` accurate position - AP `` ) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail .\nSentence 7: From it , the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager , based on the docket , or if all items are marked correct , sent back to accounting .\nSentence 8: Therefore , the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate .\nSentence 9: However , if inconsistencies exist , e.g . because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality , the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket , and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly .\nSentence 10: Based on the statements of the cost center managers , she will proceede with the clarification with the vendor , but , if necessary , she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again .\nSentence 11: When all inconsistencies are resolved , the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again , and the process continues .\nSentence 12: After all invoice items are AP , the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager .\nSentence 13: He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment .\nSentence 14: If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20 , the Board wants to check it again ( 4 - eyes-principle ) .\nSentence 15: The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file .\nSentence 16: Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit , it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier .\nSentence 17: After the commercial audit is successfully completed , the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in `` ACME financial accounting `` .\n\n\nAI: \nACME AG\tactor\t0\t\nreceives\tactivity\t0\t\nThese\tactivity

business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

Text\n\nSentence 0: At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded .\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends

It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner!

with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded .\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n"], "steps": [["mentions"]],

It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner!

The employee submits an expense report with a list of items , along with the receipts for each item .\nSentence 3: A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report .\nSentence 4: Since the company has expense rules , there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection .\nSentence 5: These rules could be automated , to reduce the workload on the supervisor .\nSentence 6: If the supervisor rejects the report , the employee , who submitted it , is given a chance to edit it , for example to correct errors or better describe an expense .\nSentence 7: If the supervisor approves the report , it goes to the treasurer .\nSentence 8: The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list .\nSentence 9: If all is in order , the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing ( including , e.g . , payment or refund , and accounting ) .\nSentence 10: If receipts are missing or do not match the report , he sends it back to the employee .\nSentence 11: If a report returns to the employee for corrections , it must again go to a supervisor , even if the supervisor previously approved the report .\nSentence 12: If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing , the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system .\nSentence 13: The process waits

Text\n\nSentence 0: The process is initiated by a switch-over request .\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\nAI: \nthe customer\tactor\t1\t\nthe customer\tactor\t26\t\nthe customer\tactor\t13\t\nThe

Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner!

Thus , in addition to handling the sale of a company \u2019 s issue , the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it .\nSentence 5: They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .\nSentence 6: In addition to registering the issue with the SEC , they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state .\nSentence 7: While the registration statement is awaiting approval , underwriters begin to firm up the issue price .\nSentence 8: They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors .\nSentence 9: Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC , underwriters fix the issue price .\nSentence 10: After that they enter into a

tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

the setup times are minimized .\nSentence 3: Besides , it creates a list of parts to be procured .\nSentence 4: Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system (

.\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\nAI: \nAt\tactivity data\t0\t\nperceives\tactivity\t0\t\nher subscribed service\tactivity data\t0\t\nhas

It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

.\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n"],

elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers

relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\nAI: \nthe

descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

the report , it goes to the treasurer .\nSentence 8: The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list .\nSentence 9: If all is in order , the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing ( including , e.g . , payment or refund , and accounting ) .\nSentence 10: If receipts are missing or do not match the report , he sends it back to the employee .\nSentence 11: If a report returns to the employee for corrections , it must again go to a supervisor , even if the supervisor previously approved the report .\nSentence 12: If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing , the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system .\nSentence 13: The process waits for the payment confirmation .\nSentence 14: After the payment

beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded .\nSentence 1: A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\nAI: \nAt\tactivity

elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not

then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO .\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\nAI: \nAt\tactivity data\t0\t\nperceives\tactivity\t0\t\nher subscribed service\tactivity data\t0\t\nhas degraded\tfurther specification\t0\t\nA list with all the

Description\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of\nprocess relevant elements in textual descriptions of business processes. These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

These mentions are\nspans of text, that are of a certain type, as described below:\n\n# Mention Types\n\n- **Actor**: a person, department, or similar role that participates actively in the business\n         process, e.g., \"the student\", \"the professor\", \"the judge\", \"the clerk\". It should\n         only be extracted, if the current sentence describes the actor executing a task.\n         Include the determiner if it is present, e.g. extract \"the student\" from \"First the\n         student studies for their exam\". Can also be a pronoun, such as \"he\", \"I\", \"she\".\n\n- **Activity**: an active task or action executed during the business process, e.g.,\n            \"examine\", \"write\", \"bake\", \"review\". Do not extract, if it is information about\n            the process itself, such as \"the process ends\", as this is not a task in the process!\n            Can also be an event during the process, that is executed by an external, implicit actor,\n            that is not mentioned in the text, e.g., \"placed\" in \"when an order is placed\".\n            Never contains the Actor that executes it, nor the Activity Data that's used during this\n            Activity, is just the verb as in \"checked\" and not \"is checked\"!\n\n- **Activity Data**: a physical object, or digital data that is relevant to the process, because\n                 an action produces or uses it, e.g., \"the paper\", \"the report\", \"the machine part\".\n                 Always include the determiner! Can also be a pronoun, like \"it\", but is always part of\n                 a task description. Is never information about the process itself, as in \"the process\n                 ends\", here \"process\" is not Activity Data!\n\n- **Further Specification**: important information about an activity, such as the mean, the manner\n                         of execution, or how an activity is executed. Follows an Activity in the\n                         same sentence, and describes how an Activity (task) is being done.\n\n- **XOR Gateway**: textual representation of a decision in the process, usually triggered by adverbs or\n               conjunctions, e.g., \"if\", \"otherwise\", \"when\"\n\n- **AND Gateway**: textual description of parallel work streams in the process, i.e., simultaneous\n               actions performed, marked by phrases like, e.g., \"while\", \"meanwhile\", \"at the same time\"\n\n- **Condition Specification**: defines the condition of an XOR Gateway path usually directly following the\n                           gateway trigger word, e.g., \"it is ready\", \"the claim is valid\",\n                           \"temperature is above 180\"\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\ntext\ttype\tsentence\n\n- **text**: the text of the mention\n- **type**: the type from the ones listed above\n- **sentence**: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Examples\n\n*Input*:\n\nSentence 0: the professor grades all student papers .\nSentence 1: some time passes .\nSentence 2: then the professor returns the papers .\n\n*Output*:\n\nthe professor\tActor\t0\ngrades\tActivity\t0\nall student papers\tActivity Data\t0\nthe professor\tActor\t2\nreturns\tActivity\t2\nthe papers\tActivity Data\t2\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not
