          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nI am the Head of the functional department . When <actor id=0> I </actor> have <activity id=5> detected </activity> <activity_data id=6> a number of personnel requirements </activity_data> , <actor id=4> I </actor> <activity id=7> report </activity> <activity_data id=8> the vacancy </activity_data> to <actor id=9> the Personnel Department </actor> .

Sometimes it also happens that the colleague from the HR department still has questions about the tasks and requirements before he can describe the job . Then I am available for clarifications , of course .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe process starts periodically on the first of each month , when Assembler AG <activity id=0> places </activity> <activity_data id=1> an order </activity_data> with <actor id=4> the supplier </actor> <further_specification id=8> in order to request more product parts </further_specification> . a ) <actor id=9> Assembler AG </actor> <activity id=12> sends </activity> <activity_data id=2> the order </activity_data> to <actor id=5> the supplier </actor> . b ) <actor id=7> The supplier </actor> <activity id=13> processes </activity> <activity_data id=3> the order </activity_data> . c ) <actor id=6> The supplier </actor> <activity id=14> sends </activity> <activity_data id=15> an invoice </activity_data> to <actor id=11> Assembler AG </actor> . d ) <actor id=10> Assembler AG </actor> <activity id=17> receives </activity> <activity_data id=16> the invoice </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The MSPO </actor> <activity id=2> deregisters </activity> at <actor id=4> the GO </actor> . <actor id=10> The GO </actor> <activity id=12> verifies </activity> <activity_data id=13> the deregistration </activity_data> . <actor id=9> The GO </actor> <activity id=16> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=15> the deregistration of the MSPO </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=17> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <further_specification id=18> preliminarily </further_specification> <activity id=19> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=14> the deregistration of the MSPO </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The GO </actor> <activity id=20> assigns </activity> <activity_data id=3> himself </activity_data> <further_specification id=21> as MSP </further_specification> . <actor id=7> The GO </actor> <activity id=22> informs </activity> <actor id=1> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=23> about the end of the assignment and the beginning of the assignment of the GO </activity_data> . <actor id=6> The GO </actor> <activity id=24> informs </activity> <actor id=25> the MPO </actor> <activity_data id=26> about the assignment of the GO </activity_data> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=27> informs </activity> <actor id=28> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=29> about the assignment of the GO </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nAfter <activity_data id=0> the Expense Report </activity_data> is <activity id=3> received </activity> , <activity_data id=4> a new account </activity_data> must be <activity id=5> created </activity> <xor_gateway id=6> if </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=7> the employee does not already have one </condition_specification> . <activity_data id=2> The report </activity_data> is then <activity id=8> reviewed </activity> <further_specification id=9> for automatic approval </further_specification> . <condition_specification id=10> Amounts under $200 </condition_specification> are <further_specification id=11> automatically </further_specification> <activity id=12> approved </activity> , <xor_gateway id=13> whereas </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=14> amounts equal to or over $200 </condition_specification> <activity id=15> require </activity> <activity_data id=16> approval </activity_data> of <actor id=17> the supervisor </actor> . <xor_gateway id=18> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=19> rejection </condition_specification> , <actor id=20> the employee </actor> must <activity id=23> receive </activity> <activity_data id=24> a rejection notice </activity_data> <further_specification id=25> by email </further_specification> . <xor_gateway id=26> Otherwise </xor_gateway> , <activity_data id=27> the reimbursement </activity_data> <activity id=28> goes </activity> <further_specification id=29> to the employees direct deposit bank account </further_specification> . <xor_gateway id=30> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=31> the request is not completed in 7 days </condition_specification> , then <actor id=22> the employee </actor> must <activity id=32> receive </activity> <activity_data id=33> an approval in progress email </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=34> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=35> the request is not finished within 30 days </condition_specification> , then the process is stopped and <actor id=21> the employee </actor> <activity id=36> receives </activity> <activity_data id=37> an email cancellation notice </activity_data> and must <activity id=38> re-submit </activity> <activity_data id=1> the expense report </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel .

The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The INQ </actor> <activity id=1> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=7> the transaction data request </activity_data> to <actor id=2> the IP </actor> . <actor id=4> The IP </actor> <activity id=5> checks </activity> <activity_data id=6> the request of the INQ </activity_data> . <actor id=3> The IP </actor> <activity id=8> answers </activity> <activity_data id=9> the question of the INQ </activity_data> <further_specification id=10> depending on the outcome of the examination </further_specification> , i.e .

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nWhen <activity_data id=0> a claim </activity_data> is <activity id=3> received </activity> , <activity_data id=2> it </activity_data> is first <activity id=4> checked </activity> whether the claimant is insured by the organization . <xor_gateway id=5> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=6> not </condition_specification> , <actor id=7> the claimant </actor> is <activity id=10> informed </activity> that <activity_data id=11> the claim must be rejected </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=12> Otherwise </xor_gateway> , <activity_data id=13> the severity of the claim </activity_data> is <activity id=14> evaluated </activity> .

The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient.

For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Then , <and_gateway id=119> two concurrent activities are triggered </and_gateway> , i.e . i ) <activity_data id=128> a report </activity_data> is <activity id=120> created </activity> for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) <activity_data id=121> an SLA violation rebate </activity_data> is <activity id=122> reported </activity> to <actor id=123> Billing & Collections </actor> <actor id=124> who </actor> will <activity id=125> adjust </activity> <activity_data id=126> the billing </activity_data> . <activity_data id=127> The report </activity_data> for the customer is <activity id=130> sent out </activity> to <actor id=132> her </actor> . After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service . After <actor id=131> the customer </actor> then <activity id=134> receives </activity> <activity_data id=129> the report </activity_data> about service performance and problem resolution from <actor id=8> Customer Service </actor> , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe process of Vacations Request starts when <actor id=0> any employee </actor> of the organization <activity id=2> submits </activity> <activity_data id=3> a vacation request </activity_data> .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The EC </actor> <activity id=1> tells </activity> <actor id=2> the INQ </actor> <activity_data id=4> about the change of his master data </activity_data> . <actor id=3> The INQ </actor> <activity id=5> notifies </activity> <actor id=6> the IP </actor> of <activity_data id=10> the change </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The IP </actor> <activity id=13> checks </activity> <further_specification id=14> whether the master data can be changed at the desired time </further_specification> . <actor id=7> The IP </actor> <activity id=15> confirmes </activity> <activity_data id=11> the changes of the INQ </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=16> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=9> the IP </actor> <activity id=17> rejectes </activity> <activity_data id=12> the changes of the INQ </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe process is initiated by a switch-over request . In doing so , <actor id=0> the customer </actor> <activity id=4> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=5> his data </activity_data> to <actor id=8> the customer service department </actor> of the company . Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution . <activity_data id=6> The customer data </activity_data> is <activity id=13> received </activity> by <actor id=11> customer service </actor> and based on this data <activity_data id=14> a customer data object </activity_data> is <activity id=15> entered </activity> <further_specification id=16> into the CRM system </further_specification> . After customer data has been entered <activity_data id=7> it </activity_data> should then be <activity id=17> compared </activity> with <activity_data id=18> the internal customer data base </activity_data> and <activity id=19> checked </activity> <further_specification id=20> for completeness and plausibility </further_specification> . <xor_gateway id=21> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=22> any errors </condition_specification> <activity_data id=23> these </activity_data> should be <activity id=24> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list . The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times . <xor_gateway id=25> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=26> the customer does not exist in the customer data base </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=27> a new customer object </activity_data> is being <activity id=28> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow . This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity id=29> prepare </activity> <activity_data id=30> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated <activity id=33> check </activity> of <activity_data id=32> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor id=34> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . <xor_gateway id=36> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=37> a negative response </condition_specification> , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data id=38> the causing issues </activity_data> are being <activity id=39> analyzed </activity> and <activity id=40> resolved </activity> . Subsequently <activity_data id=31> the contract documents </activity_data> are <activity id=41> generated </activity> once again . <xor_gateway id=42> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=43> a positive response </condition_specification> <activity_data id=44> a confirmation document </activity_data> is <activity id=45> sent out </activity> to <actor id=2> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed . <activity_data id=46> A request </activity_data> to <actor id=48> the grid operator </actor> is automatically <activity id=55> sent out </activity> by <actor id=35> the CIS </actor> . It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future . <activity_data id=47> The switch-over request </activity_data> is <activity id=56> checked </activity> by <actor id=53> the grid operator </actor> for supplier concurrence , and <actor id=52> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=57> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=58> a response comment </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=59> In the case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=60> supplier concurrence </condition_specification> <actor id=51> the grid operator </actor> would <activity id=61> inform </activity> <actor id=62> all involved suppliers </actor> and <activity id=63> demand </activity> <activity_data id=64> the resolution of the conflict </activity_data> . <actor id=54> The grid operator </actor> <activity id=65> communicates </activity> with <actor id=66> the old supplier </actor> and <activity id=70> carries out </activity> <activity_data id=71> the termination of the sales agreement </activity_data> between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) . <xor_gateway id=72> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=73> there are not any objections by the grid operator </condition_specification> ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor id=10> customer service </actor> <activity id=74> creates </activity> <activity_data id=75> a CIS contract </activity_data> . <actor id=3> The customer </actor> then has the chance to <activity id=78> check </activity> <activity_data id=79> the contract details </activity_data> and based on this check may decide to <xor_gateway id=80> either </xor_gateway> <activity id=81> withdraw </activity> from <activity_data id=76> the switch contract </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=82> or </xor_gateway> <activity id=83> confirm </activity> <activity_data id=77> it </activity_data> . Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) . An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor id=50> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=84> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=85> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor id=12> the customer service </actor> and <actor id=69> the old supplier </actor> <further_specification id=88> via messages containing a services consumption report </further_specification> . <and_gateway id=89> At the same time </and_gateway> , <actor id=49> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=90> computes </activity> <activity_data id=91> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and <activity id=94> sends </activity> <activity_data id=92> it </activity_data> to <actor id=68> the old supplier </actor> . Likewise <actor id=67> the old supplier </actor> <activity id=95> creates </activity> and <activity id=96> sends </activity> <activity_data id=93> the final billing </activity_data> to <actor id=1> the customer </actor> . For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After <activity id=97> receiving </activity> <activity_data id=86> the meter data </activity_data> <actor id=9> customer service </actor> <activity id=98> imports </activity> <activity_data id=87> the meter data </activity_data> to systems that require the information . The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<xor_gateway id=0> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=1> the MPOO </actor> <activity id=3> sends </activity> <activity_data id=4> the bill for the temporary continuation of the metering point operations </activity_data> to <actor id=6> the GO </actor> , <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <activity id=12> examines </activity> <activity_data id=5> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=13> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=14> the MSPO </actor> <activity id=15> sends </activity> <activity_data id=16> the bill for the temporary continuation of the measurement </activity_data> to <actor id=10> the GO </actor> , <actor id=9> the GO </actor> <activity id=18> examines </activity> <activity_data id=17> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=19> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=20> the MSPO </actor> <activity id=21> sends </activity> <activity_data id=22> the bill for additional readings </activity_data> to <actor id=8> the GO </actor> , <actor id=7> the GO </actor> <activity id=24> examines </activity> <activity_data id=23> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=25> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=2> the MPOO </actor> <activity id=26> sends </activity> <activity_data id=27> the bill for the equipment acquisition </activity_data> to <actor id=29> the MPON or the GO </actor> , <actor id=30> the MPON or the GO </actor> <activity id=33> examines </activity> <activity_data id=28> the bill </activity_data> . <actor id=31> The GO or the MPON </actor> <activity id=34> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=35> the invoice with payment advice </activity_data> to <actor id=37> the MPOO or the MSPO </actor> , <xor_gateway id=38> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=32> the GO or the MPON </actor> <activity id=39> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=36> the invoice of the MPOO or the MSPO </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe loan approval process starts by <activity id=0> receiving </activity> a customer request for a loan amount . <actor id=1> The risk assessment Web service </actor> is invoked to <activity id=2> assess </activity> <activity_data id=3> the request </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=5> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=6> the loan is small and the customer is low risk </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=7> the loan </activity_data> is <activity id=9> approved </activity> . <xor_gateway id=10> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=11> the customer is high risk </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=8> the loan </activity_data> is <activity id=12> denied </activity> . <xor_gateway id=13> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=14> the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10,000 or more </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=4> the request </activity_data> is <activity id=15> sent </activity> to <actor id=16> the approver Web service </actor> . <actor id=17> The customer </actor> <activity id=18> receives </activity> <activity_data id=19> feedback </activity_data> from <actor id=20> the assessor or approver </actor> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The MPOO </actor> <activity id=4> deregisters </activity> at <actor id=7> the GO </actor> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=15> verifies </activity> <activity_data id=16> the deregistration </activity_data> . <actor id=14> The GO </actor> <activity id=19> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=18> the deregistration of the MPOO </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=20> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=6> the GO </actor> <further_specification id=21> preliminarily </further_specification> <activity id=22> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=17> the deregistration of the MPOO </activity_data> . <actor id=13> The GO </actor> <activity id=23> prepares </activity> <activity_data id=24> the readmission of the measuring point </activity_data> .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nI am the HR clerk .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=1> The MSPN </actor> <activity id=2> registers </activity> <activity_data id=3> the measurement </activity_data> at <actor id=4> the GO </actor> . <actor id=10> The GO </actor> <activity id=12> examines </activity> <activity_data id=13> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=9> The GO </actor> <activity id=16> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=15> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=17> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <activity id=18> confirmes </activity> <activity_data id=14> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The GO </actor> <activity id=19> assigns </activity> <activity_data id=0> the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=7> The GO </actor> <activity id=20> informs </activity> <actor id=21> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=22> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=6> The GO </actor> <activity id=25> informs </activity> <actor id=26> the MPO </actor> <activity_data id=23> about the assignment of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=27> informs </activity> <actor id=28> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=24> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> .\n\n\n"
