Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs.

Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Based on this , <activity_data id=19> the necessary counter measures </activity_data> are <activity id=20> determined </activity> including their respective priorities . <actor id=21> An electronic service </actor> then <activity id=22> determines </activity> <activity_data id=23> the significance of the customer </activity_data> based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship . <xor_gateway id=24> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=25> the customer is premium </condition_specification> , the process will link to an extra <activity_data id=51> problem </activity_data> <activity id=26> fix </activity> process ( this process will not be detailed here ) . <xor_gateway id=27> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=28> the customer is of certain significance </condition_specification> which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures <xor_gateway id=29> otherwise </xor_gateway> the process continues . Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) <activity_data id=30> a detailed problem report </activity_data> is <activity id=34> created </activity> . <activity_data id=31> The detailed problem report </activity_data> is then <activity id=35> sent </activity> to <actor id=36> Service Management </actor> . <actor id=43> Service Management </actor> <activity id=47> deals </activity> on a first level with <activity_data id=48> violations of quality in services </activity_data> that are provided to customers . After receiving the detailed problem report , <actor id=44> Service management </actor> <activity id=49> investigates </activity> whether <activity_data id=50> the problem </activity_data> is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning . <xor_gateway id=52> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=53> Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=33> the detailed problem report </activity_data> is <activity id=54> sent out </activity> to <actor id=55> Resource Provisioning </actor> . <xor_gateway id=60> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=61> Service Management is sure they can analyze it </condition_specification> , <actor id=46> they </actor> <activity id=62> perform </activity> <activity_data id=63> the analysis </activity_data> and based on the outcome <actor id=45> they </actor> <activity id=64> create </activity> <activity_data id=65> a trouble report </activity_data> that indicates the type of problem . After <actor id=59> Resource Provisioning </actor> <activity id=68> receives </activity> <activity_data id=32> the detailed problem report </activity_data> , <activity_data id=69> it </activity_data> is <activity id=70> checked </activity> whether there are any possible problems . <xor_gateway id=71> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=72> no problems are detected </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=73> a notification </activity_data> about the normal service execution is <activity id=74> created </activity> . <xor_gateway id=75> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=76> a problem is detected </condition_specification> <activity_data id=77> this </activity_data> will be <activity id=78> analyzed </activity> by <actor id=58> Resource Provisioning </actor> and <activity_data id=66> a trouble report </activity_data> is <activity id=79> created </activity> . Either <activity_data id=67> trouble report </activity_data> or <activity_data id=80> the normal execution notification </activity_data> will be <activity id=81> included </activity> in a status report and <activity id=82> sent back </activity> to <actor id=42> Service Management </actor> . <actor id=41> Service Management </actor> then <activity id=83> prepares </activity> <activity_data id=84> the final status report </activity_data> based on the received information . Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report . Three alternative process paths may be taken . <xor_gateway id=85> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=86> no problem was detected at all </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=87> the actual service performance </activity_data> is <activity id=88> sent back </activity> to <actor id=7> the Customer Service </actor> . <xor_gateway id=89> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=90> minor corrective actions are required </condition_specification> , <actor id=40> Service Management </actor> will <activity id=91> undertake </activity> <activity_data id=92> corrective actions </activity_data> by themselves . Subsequently , <activity_data id=93> the problem resolution report </activity_data> is <activity id=96> created </activity> and then <activity id=97> sent out </activity> to <actor id=10> Customer Service </actor> . After sending , this process path of Service Management ends . <xor_gateway id=98> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=99> automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required </condition_specification> , <actor id=39> Service Management </actor> must <activity id=100> create </activity> <activity_data id=101> a request </activity_data> for automatic resource restoration . <activity_data id=103> This message </activity_data> is then <activity id=104> sent </activity> to <actor id=57> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process . After <activity_data id=102> the restoration request </activity_data> is <activity id=105> received </activity> , <activity_data id=106> all possible errors </activity_data> are <activity id=107> tracked </activity> . Based on the tracked errors , all necessary <activity_data id=108> corrective actions </activity_data> are <activity id=109> undertaken </activity> by <actor id=56> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Then <activity_data id=110> a trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is <activity id=113> created </activity> . <activity_data id=111> This report </activity_data> is <activity id=114> sent out </activity> to <actor id=38> Service Management </actor> ; then the process ends . <activity_data id=112> The trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is <activity id=115> received </activity> by <actor id=37> Service Management </actor> and this information goes then into the <activity id=116> creation </activity> of <activity_data id=95> the problem resolution report </activity_data> just as described for ii ) . <actor id=9> Customer Service </actor> either <activity id=117> receives </activity> <activity_data id=118> the actual service performance </activity_data> ( if there was no problem ) or <activity_data id=94> the problem resolution report </activity_data> . Then , <and_gateway id=119> two concurrent activities are triggered </and_gateway> , i.e . i ) <activity_data id=128> a report </activity_data> is <activity id=120> created </activity> for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) <activity_data id=121> an SLA violation rebate </activity_data> is <activity id=122> reported </activity> to <actor id=123> Billing & Collections </actor> <actor id=124> who </actor> will <activity id=125> adjust </activity> <activity_data id=126> the billing </activity_data> . <activity_data id=127> The report </activity_data> for the customer is <activity id=130> sent out </activity> to <actor id=132> her </actor> . After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service . After <actor id=131> the customer </actor> then <activity id=134> receives </activity> <activity_data id=129> the report </activity_data> about service performance and problem resolution from <actor id=8> Customer Service </actor> , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\n"], "steps": [["relations"]], "formatter_args": [{"prompt": "pet/re/ablation/baseline.txt", "only_tags": null, "context_tags": null}], "formatters": ["PetRelationListingFormattingStrategy"], "input_tokens": 3361, "output_tokens": 2553, "total_costs": 0.00551, "answers": ["1.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention.

The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\".

If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\".

The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them.

The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs.

Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1.

The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=1> The MSPN </actor> <activity id=2> registers </activity> <activity_data id=3> the measurement </activity_data> at <actor id=4> the GO </actor> . <actor id=10> The GO </actor> <activity id=12> examines </activity> <activity_data id=13> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=9> The GO </actor> <activity id=16> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=15> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=17> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <activity id=18> confirmes </activity> <activity_data id=14> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The GO </actor> <activity id=19> assigns </activity> <activity_data id=0> the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=7> The GO </actor> <activity id=20> informs </activity> <actor id=21> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=22> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=6> The GO </actor> <activity id=25> informs </activity> <actor id=26> the MPO </actor> <activity_data id=23> about the assignment of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=27> informs </activity> <actor id=28> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=24> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> .\n\n\n"], "steps": [["relations"]], "formatter_args": [{"prompt": "pet/re/ablation/baseline.txt", "only_tags": null, "context_tags": null}], "formatters": ["PetRelationListingFormattingStrategy"], "input_tokens": 1554, "output_tokens": 102, "total_costs": 0.00093, "answers": ["1.
