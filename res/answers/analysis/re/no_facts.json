          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nI am the Head of the functional department . When <actor id=0> I </actor> have <activity id=5> detected </activity> <activity_data id=6> a number of personnel requirements </activity_data> , <actor id=4> I </actor> <activity id=7> report </activity> <activity_data id=8> the vacancy </activity_data> to <actor id=9> the Personnel Department </actor> .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe process starts periodically on the first of each month , when Assembler AG <activity id=0> places </activity> <activity_data id=1> an order </activity_data> with <actor id=4> the supplier </actor> <further_specification id=8> in order to request more product parts </further_specification> . a ) <actor id=9> Assembler AG </actor> <activity id=12> sends </activity> <activity_data id=2> the order </activity_data> to <actor id=5> the supplier </actor> . b ) <actor id=7> The supplier </actor> <activity id=13> processes </activity> <activity_data id=3> the order </activity_data> . c ) <actor id=6> The supplier </actor> <activity id=14> sends </activity> <activity_data id=15> an invoice </activity_data> to <actor id=11> Assembler AG </actor> . d ) <actor id=10> Assembler AG </actor> <activity id=17> receives </activity> <activity_data id=16> the invoice </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The MSPO </actor> <activity id=2> deregisters </activity> at <actor id=4> the GO </actor> . <actor id=10> The GO </actor> <activity id=12> verifies </activity> <activity_data id=13> the deregistration </activity_data> . <actor id=9> The GO </actor> <activity id=16> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=15> the deregistration of the MSPO </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=17> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <further_specification id=18> preliminarily </further_specification> <activity id=19> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=14> the deregistration of the MSPO </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The GO </actor> <activity id=20> assigns </activity> <activity_data id=3> himself </activity_data> <further_specification id=21> as MSP </further_specification> . <actor id=7> The GO </actor> <activity id=22> informs </activity> <actor id=1> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=23> about the end of the assignment and the beginning of the assignment of the GO </activity_data> . <actor id=6> The GO </actor> <activity id=24> informs </activity> <actor id=25> the MPO </actor> <activity_data id=26> about the assignment of the GO </activity_data> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=27> informs </activity> <actor id=28> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=29> about the assignment of the GO </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The MPON </actor> <activity id=9> reports </activity> <activity_data id=10> the meter operation </activity_data> to <actor id=19> the GO </actor> . <actor id=11> The GO </actor> <activity id=28> examines </activity> <activity_data id=31> the application </activity_data> of <actor id=8> the MPON </actor> . <actor id=27> The GO </actor> <activity id=29> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=30> the application of the MPON </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=33> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=18> the GO </actor> <activity id=34> confirmes </activity> <activity_data id=32> the application of the MPON </activity_data> . <actor id=26> The GO </actor> <activity id=35> informs </activity> <actor id=36> the MPOO </actor> <activity_data id=40> about the registration confirmation of the MPON </activity_data> . <actor id=25> The GO </actor> <activity id=42> informs </activity> <actor id=43> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=41> about the registration confirmation of the MPON </activity_data> . <actor id=2> The MPON </actor> and <actor id=39> the MPOO </actor> <activity id=46> perform </activity> <activity_data id=47> the equipment acquisition and / or equipment changes </activity_data> . <actor id=1> The MPON </actor> <activity id=48> informs </activity> <actor id=17> the GO </actor> <activity_data id=49> about the failure of the entire process </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=50> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=7> the MPON </actor> <activity id=51> informs </activity> <actor id=16> the GO </actor> <activity_data id=52> about the successful completion of the entire process </activity_data> . <actor id=24> The GO </actor> <activity id=53> informs </activity> <actor id=6> the MPON </actor> <activity_data id=54> about the failure of the overall transaction by deadline </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=55> if </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=56> after a maximum time limit no message of the MPON is present at the GO </condition_specification> . <xor_gateway id=57> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=58> the MPON informs the GO about the failure of the entire process </condition_specification> , <actor id=15> the GO </actor> <activity id=59> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=60> the failure of the assignment </activity_data> to <actor id=5> the MPON </actor> . <xor_gateway id=61> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=62> the MPON informs the GO about the successful completion of the overall process </condition_specification> , <actor id=14> the GO </actor> <activity id=63> assigns </activity> <actor id=4> the MPON </actor> . <actor id=23> The GO </actor> <activity id=64> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=65> the assignment </activity_data> to <actor id=3> the MPON </actor> . <actor id=22> The GO </actor> <activity id=66> informs </activity> <actor id=38> the MPOO </actor> <activity_data id=67> about the failure of the assignment of the MPON </activity_data> or <actor id=13> the GO </actor> <activity id=68> informs </activity> <actor id=37> the MPOO </actor> <activity_data id=69> about the assignment of the MPON </activity_data> . <actor id=21> The GO </actor> <activity id=70> informs </activity> <actor id=45> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=71> about the failure of the assignment of the MPON </activity_data> or <actor id=12> the GO </actor> <activity id=72> informs </activity> <actor id=44> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=73> about the assignment of the MPON </activity_data> . <actor id=20> The GO </actor> <activity id=74> informs </activity> <actor id=75> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=76> about the assignment of the MPON </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs.

Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe first step is to <activity id=0> determine </activity> <activity_data id=1> contact details </activity_data> of potential customers .

Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The MSPN </actor> <activity id=1> sents </activity> <activity_data id=2> a dismissal </activity_data> to <actor id=6> the MSPO </actor> . <actor id=9> The MSPO </actor> <activity id=10> reviews </activity> <activity_data id=3> the dismissal </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The MSPO </actor> <activity id=11> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=5> the dismissal of the MSPN </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=12> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=7> The MSPO </actor> <activity id=13> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=4> the dismissal of the MSPN </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=0> The Customer Service Representative </actor> <activity id=1> sends </activity> <activity_data id=2> a Mortgage offer </activity_data> to <actor id=3> the customer </actor> and <activity id=5> waits for </activity> <activity_data id=6> a reply </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=7> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=8> the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=9> the case details </activity_data> are <activity id=11> updated </activity> and <activity_data id=12> the work </activity_data> is then <activity id=13> archived </activity> prior to <activity id=14> cancellation </activity> . <xor_gateway id=15> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=16> the customer sends back the completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents </condition_specification> then <activity_data id=17> the case </activity_data> is <activity id=18> moved </activity> to <actor id=19> administration </actor> for completion . <xor_gateway id=20> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=21> all pre-requisite documents are not provided </condition_specification> <activity_data id=22> a message </activity_data> is <activity id=23> generated </activity> to <actor id=4> the customer </actor> <further_specification id=24> requesting outstanding documents </further_specification> . <xor_gateway id=25> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=26> no answer is received after 2 weeks </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=10> the case details </activity_data> are <activity id=27> updated </activity> prior to <activity id=28> archive </activity> and <activity id=29> cancellation </activity> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe process is triggered by the <activity id=0> demand </activity> of <actor id=1> a functional department </actor> <activity_data id=2> to fill a post </activity_data> . <activity_data id=3> The post </activity_data> is <activity id=5> advertised </activity> , <actor id=6> applicants </actor> <activity id=7> apply </activity> , <activity_data id=8> the applications </activity_data> are <activity id=9> checked </activity> and <activity_data id=4> the post </activity_data> is <activity id=10> filled </activity> .

Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<activity_data id=0> At </activity_data> the beginning <actor id=133> the customer </actor> <activity id=1> perceives </activity> that <activity_data id=2> her subscribed service </activity_data> <further_specification id=3> has degraded </further_specification> . <activity_data id=4> A list with all the problem parameters </activity_data> is then <activity id=5> sent </activity> to <actor id=6> the Customer Service department of TELECO </actor> . At the customer service <actor id=11> an employee </actor> <activity id=12> enters </activity> ( based on the received data ) <activity_data id=13> a problem report </activity_data> into system T . . Then <activity_data id=14> the problem report </activity_data> is <activity id=15> compared </activity> <further_specification id=16> to the customer SLA </further_specification> to <activity id=17> identify </activity> what the extent and <activity_data id=18> the details of the service degradation </activity_data> are . Based on this , <activity_data id=19> the necessary counter measures </activity_data> are <activity id=20> determined </activity> including their respective priorities . <actor id=21> An electronic service </actor> then <activity id=22> determines </activity> <activity_data id=23> the significance of the customer </activity_data> based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship . <xor_gateway id=24> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=25> the customer is premium </condition_specification> , the process will link to an extra <activity_data id=51> problem </activity_data> <activity id=26> fix </activity> process ( this process will not be detailed here ) . <xor_gateway id=27> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=28> the customer is of certain significance </condition_specification> which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures <xor_gateway id=29> otherwise </xor_gateway> the process continues . Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) <activity_data id=30> a detailed problem report </activity_data> is <activity id=34> created </activity> . <activity_data id=31> The detailed problem report </activity_data> is then <activity id=35> sent </activity> to <actor id=36> Service Management </actor> . <actor id=43> Service Management </actor> <activity id=47> deals </activity> on a first level with <activity_data id=48> violations of quality in services </activity_data> that are provided to customers . After receiving the detailed problem report , <actor id=44> Service management </actor> <activity id=49> investigates </activity> whether <activity_data id=50> the problem </activity_data> is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning . <xor_gateway id=52> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=53> Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=33> the detailed problem report </activity_data> is <activity id=54> sent out </activity> to <actor id=55> Resource Provisioning </actor> . <xor_gateway id=60> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=61> Service Management is sure they can analyze it </condition_specification> , <actor id=46> they </actor> <activity id=62> perform </activity> <activity_data id=63> the analysis </activity_data> and based on the outcome <actor id=45> they </actor> <activity id=64> create </activity> <activity_data id=65> a trouble report </activity_data> that indicates the type of problem . After <actor id=59> Resource Provisioning </actor> <activity id=68> receives </activity> <activity_data id=32> the detailed problem report </activity_data> , <activity_data id=69> it </activity_data> is <activity id=70> checked </activity> whether there are any possible problems . <xor_gateway id=71> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=72> no problems are detected </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=73> a notification </activity_data> about the normal service execution is <activity id=74> created </activity> . <xor_gateway id=75> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=76> a problem is detected </condition_specification> <activity_data id=77> this </activity_data> will be <activity id=78> analyzed </activity> by <actor id=58> Resource Provisioning </actor> and <activity_data id=66> a trouble report </activity_data> is <activity id=79> created </activity> . Either <activity_data id=67> trouble report </activity_data> or <activity_data id=80> the normal execution notification </activity_data> will be <activity id=81> included </activity> in a status report and <activity id=82> sent back </activity> to <actor id=42> Service Management </actor> . <actor id=41> Service Management </actor> then <activity id=83> prepares </activity> <activity_data id=84> the final status report </activity_data> based on the received information . Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report . Three alternative process paths may be taken . <xor_gateway id=85> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=86> no problem was detected at all </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=87> the actual service performance </activity_data> is <activity id=88> sent back </activity> to <actor id=7> the Customer Service </actor> . <xor_gateway id=89> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=90> minor corrective actions are required </condition_specification> , <actor id=40> Service Management </actor> will <activity id=91> undertake </activity> <activity_data id=92> corrective actions </activity_data> by themselves . Subsequently , <activity_data id=93> the problem resolution report </activity_data> is <activity id=96> created </activity> and then <activity id=97> sent out </activity> to <actor id=10> Customer Service </actor> . After sending , this process path of Service Management ends . <xor_gateway id=98> For the case </xor_gateway> that <condition_specification id=99> automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required </condition_specification> , <actor id=39> Service Management </actor> must <activity id=100> create </activity> <activity_data id=101> a request </activity_data> for automatic resource restoration . <activity_data id=103> This message </activity_data> is then <activity id=104> sent </activity> to <actor id=57> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process . After <activity_data id=102> the restoration request </activity_data> is <activity id=105> received </activity> , <activity_data id=106> all possible errors </activity_data> are <activity id=107> tracked </activity> . Based on the tracked errors , all necessary <activity_data id=108> corrective actions </activity_data> are <activity id=109> undertaken </activity> by <actor id=56> Resource Provisioning </actor> . Then <activity_data id=110> a trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is <activity id=113> created </activity> . <activity_data id=111> This report </activity_data> is <activity id=114> sent out </activity> to <actor id=38> Service Management </actor> ; then the process ends . <activity_data id=112> The trouble-shooting report </activity_data> is <activity id=115> received </activity> by <actor id=37> Service Management </actor> and this information goes then into the <activity id=116> creation </activity> of <activity_data id=95> the problem resolution report </activity_data> just as described for ii ) . <actor id=9> Customer Service </actor> either <activity id=117> receives </activity> <activity_data id=118> the actual service performance </activity_data> ( if there was no problem ) or <activity_data id=94> the problem resolution report </activity_data> . Then , <and_gateway id=119> two concurrent activities are triggered </and_gateway> , i.e . i ) <activity_data id=128> a report </activity_data> is <activity id=120> created </activity> for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) <activity_data id=121> an SLA violation rebate </activity_data> is <activity id=122> reported </activity> to <actor id=123> Billing & Collections </actor> <actor id=124> who </actor> will <activity id=125> adjust </activity> <activity_data id=126> the billing </activity_data> . <activity_data id=127> The report </activity_data> for the customer is <activity id=130> sent out </activity> to <actor id=132> her </actor> . After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service . After <actor id=131> the customer </actor> then <activity id=134> receives </activity> <activity_data id=129> the report </activity_data> about service performance and problem resolution from <actor id=8> Customer Service </actor> , the process flow at the customer also ends .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient.

For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nFirst , <actor id=0> the Manager </actor> <activity id=5> checks </activity> <activity_data id=6> the open leads </activity_data> .

In doing so , <actor id=0> the customer </actor> <activity id=4> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=5> his data </activity_data> to <actor id=8> the customer service department </actor> of the company . Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution . <activity_data id=6> The customer data </activity_data> is <activity id=13> received </activity> by <actor id=11> customer service </actor> and based on this data <activity_data id=14> a customer data object </activity_data> is <activity id=15> entered </activity> <further_specification id=16> into the CRM system </further_specification> .

The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times . <xor_gateway id=25> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=26> the customer does not exist in the customer data base </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=27> a new customer object </activity_data> is being <activity id=28> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow . This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity id=29> prepare </activity> <activity_data id=30> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated <activity id=33> check </activity> of <activity_data id=32> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor id=34> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . <xor_gateway id=36> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=37> a negative response </condition_specification> , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data id=38> the causing issues </activity_data> are being <activity id=39> analyzed </activity> and <activity id=40> resolved </activity> . Subsequently <activity_data id=31> the contract documents </activity_data> are <activity id=41> generated </activity> once again . <xor_gateway id=42> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=43> a positive response </condition_specification> <activity_data id=44> a confirmation document </activity_data> is <activity id=45> sent out </activity> to <actor id=2> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed . <activity_data id=46> A request </activity_data> to <actor id=48> the grid operator </actor> is automatically <activity id=55> sent out </activity> by <actor id=35> the CIS </actor> .

Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) . An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor id=50> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=84> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=85> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor id=12> the customer service </actor> and <actor id=69> the old supplier </actor> <further_specification id=88> via messages containing a services consumption report </further_specification> . <and_gateway id=89> At the same time </and_gateway> , <actor id=49> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=90> computes </activity> <activity_data id=91> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and <activity id=94> sends </activity> <activity_data id=92> it </activity_data> to <actor id=68> the old supplier </actor> . Likewise <actor id=67> the old supplier </actor> <activity id=95> creates </activity> and <activity id=96> sends </activity> <activity_data id=93> the final billing </activity_data> to <actor id=1> the customer </actor> . For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After <activity id=97> receiving </activity> <activity_data id=86> the meter data </activity_data> <actor id=9> customer service </actor> <activity id=98> imports </activity> <activity_data id=87> the meter data </activity_data> to systems that require the information . The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<xor_gateway id=0> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=1> the MPOO </actor> <activity id=3> sends </activity> <activity_data id=4> the bill for the temporary continuation of the metering point operations </activity_data> to <actor id=6> the GO </actor> , <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <activity id=12> examines </activity> <activity_data id=5> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=13> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=14> the MSPO </actor> <activity id=15> sends </activity> <activity_data id=16> the bill for the temporary continuation of the measurement </activity_data> to <actor id=10> the GO </actor> , <actor id=9> the GO </actor> <activity id=18> examines </activity> <activity_data id=17> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=19> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=20> the MSPO </actor> <activity id=21> sends </activity> <activity_data id=22> the bill for additional readings </activity_data> to <actor id=8> the GO </actor> , <actor id=7> the GO </actor> <activity id=24> examines </activity> <activity_data id=23> the bill </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=25> If </xor_gateway> <actor id=2> the MPOO </actor> <activity id=26> sends </activity> <activity_data id=27> the bill for the equipment acquisition </activity_data> to <actor id=29> the MPON or the GO </actor> , <actor id=30> the MPON or the GO </actor> <activity id=33> examines </activity> <activity_data id=28> the bill </activity_data> . <actor id=31> The GO or the MPON </actor> <activity id=34> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=35> the invoice with payment advice </activity_data> to <actor id=37> the MPOO or the MSPO </actor> , <xor_gateway id=38> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=32> the GO or the MPON </actor> <activity id=39> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=36> the invoice of the MPOO or the MSPO </activity_data> .\n\n\n"

For each new assignment , it is also <activity id=46> determined </activity> whether <activity_data id=47> the medical file of the patient </activity_data> is required . <activity_data id=48> This information </activity_data> is <activity id=49> added </activity> <further_specification id=50> to the assignment list </further_specification> . <actor id=51> The secretarial office </actor> <activity id=60> stores </activity> the assignment of each patient of the assignment list <further_specification id=61> in the information system </further_specification> . <actor id=59> It </actor> <activity id=62> passes </activity> <activity_data id=63> the produced registration cards </activity_data> to <actor id=64> the first and second intaker </actor> of each newly assigned patient . An intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office . <xor_gateway id=65> For each patient for which </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=66> the medical file is required </condition_specification> , <actor id=56> the secretarial office </actor> <activity id=67> prepares </activity> and <activity id=68> sends </activity> <activity_data id=69> a letter </activity_data> to <actor id=70> the family doctor of the patient </actor> , requesting for a copy of the medical file .

During the first meeting , <activity_data id=83> the patient </activity_data> is <activity id=84> examined </activity> using a standard checklist which is filled out . <activity_data id=85> Additional observations </activity_data> are <activity id=86> registered </activity> <further_specification id=87> in a personal notebook </further_specification> . After a visit , <actor id=80> the first intaker </actor> <activity id=88> puts </activity> <activity_data id=89> a copy of these notes </activity_data> <further_specification id=90> in the file of a patient </further_specification> . <activity_data id=91> The standard checklist </activity_data> is also <activity id=92> added </activity> <further_specification id=93> to the patient's file </further_specification> . <actor id=75> The second intaker </actor> <activity id=94> plans </activity> <activity_data id=95> the first meeting </activity_data> only after the medical information of the physician <xor_gateway id=96> if </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=97> required has been received </condition_specification> . Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients . <actor id=52> The secretarial office </actor> <activity id=98> types out </activity> <activity_data id=99> these tapes </activity_data> , after which <activity_data id=100> the information </activity_data> is <activity id=101> added </activity> <further_specification id=102> to the patient file </further_specification> . As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place , <actor id=54> the secretarial office </actor> <activity id=103> puts </activity> the patient <further_specification id=104> on the list of patients that reach this status </further_specification> .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nThe loan approval process starts by <activity id=0> receiving </activity> a customer request for a loan amount . <actor id=1> The risk assessment Web service </actor> is invoked to <activity id=2> assess </activity> <activity_data id=3> the request </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=5> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=6> the loan is small and the customer is low risk </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=7> the loan </activity_data> is <activity id=9> approved </activity> . <xor_gateway id=10> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=11> the customer is high risk </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=8> the loan </activity_data> is <activity id=12> denied </activity> . <xor_gateway id=13> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=14> the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10,000 or more </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=4> the request </activity_data> is <activity id=15> sent </activity> to <actor id=16> the approver Web service </actor> . <actor id=17> The customer </actor> <activity id=18> receives </activity> <activity_data id=19> feedback </activity_data> from <actor id=20> the assessor or approver </actor> .\n\n\n"

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them.

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nI am the HR clerk .

          "System: # Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"uses\". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the \"activity_data\" mention.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor performer\". The source mention is the \"activity\", and the target mention is the \"actor\".\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"actor recipient\". The source mention is the \"Activity\", the target mention is the \"Actor\".\n\n- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type \"xor_gateway\" and \"and_gateway\". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type \"same gateway\", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type \"further_specification\", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type \"further_specification\".\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 5 steps.\n\n1. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n2. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow. The source Activity is the one that is performed first, and the target the one performed after the first. The occurrence in the text is not enough to determine the direction, you have to reason using the text!\n\nGiven the text \"The LLM extracts mentions after it listed facts about the process.\", this would an incorrect flow relation. source: extracts, target: listed.\n\n## Format\n\nRetrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.\n\n<relation-type>\t<source-mention-index>\t<target-mention-index>\t<explanation>\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- <relation-type>: the type of the relation, one of the ones listed above\n- <source-mention-index>: index of the source mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <target-mention-index>: index of the target mention as given in its xml-like tag\n- <explanation>: short explanation why this relation was extracted\n\n### Input Example\n\nSentence 0: the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .\n\n### Output Example\n\nactor performer\t0\t1\tthe activity extracts is performed by the LLM\nuses\t0\t2\tthis activity_data mention is produced by the activity extracts\n\nHuman: Please retrieve all relations from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\n<actor id=1> The MSPN </actor> <activity id=2> registers </activity> <activity_data id=3> the measurement </activity_data> at <actor id=4> the GO </actor> . <actor id=10> The GO </actor> <activity id=12> examines </activity> <activity_data id=13> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=9> The GO </actor> <activity id=16> rejects </activity> <activity_data id=15> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=17> or </xor_gateway> <actor id=11> the GO </actor> <activity id=18> confirmes </activity> <activity_data id=14> the application of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=8> The GO </actor> <activity id=19> assigns </activity> <activity_data id=0> the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=7> The GO </actor> <activity id=20> informs </activity> <actor id=21> the MSPO </actor> <activity_data id=22> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=6> The GO </actor> <activity id=25> informs </activity> <actor id=26> the MPO </actor> <activity_data id=23> about the assignment of the MSPN </activity_data> . <actor id=5> The GO </actor> <activity id=27> informs </activity> <actor id=28> the SP </actor> <activity_data id=24> about the assignment of MSPN </activity_data> .\n\n\n"
