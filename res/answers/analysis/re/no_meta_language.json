In doing so , <actor id=0> the customer </actor> <activity id=4> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=5> his data </activity_data> to <actor id=8> the customer service department </actor> of the company . Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution . <activity_data id=6> The customer data </activity_data> is <activity id=13> received </activity> by <actor id=11> customer service </actor> and based on this data <activity_data id=14> a customer data object </activity_data> is <activity id=15> entered </activity> <further_specification id=16> into the CRM system </further_specification> . After customer data has been entered <activity_data id=7> it </activity_data> should then be <activity id=17> compared </activity> with <activity_data id=18> the internal customer data base </activity_data> and <activity id=19> checked </activity> <further_specification id=20> for completeness and plausibility </further_specification> . <xor_gateway id=21> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=22> any errors </condition_specification> <activity_data id=23> these </activity_data> should be <activity id=24> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list . The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times . <xor_gateway id=25> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=26> the customer does not exist in the customer data base </condition_specification> , <activity_data id=27> a new customer object </activity_data> is being <activity id=28> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow . This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity id=29> prepare </activity> <activity_data id=30> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated <activity id=33> check </activity> of <activity_data id=32> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor id=34> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . <xor_gateway id=36> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=37> a negative response </condition_specification> , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data id=38> the causing issues </activity_data> are being <activity id=39> analyzed </activity> and <activity id=40> resolved </activity> . Subsequently <activity_data id=31> the contract documents </activity_data> are <activity id=41> generated </activity> once again . <xor_gateway id=42> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=43> a positive response </condition_specification> <activity_data id=44> a confirmation document </activity_data> is <activity id=45> sent out </activity> to <actor id=2> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed . <activity_data id=46> A request </activity_data> to <actor id=48> the grid operator </actor> is automatically <activity id=55> sent out </activity> by <actor id=35> the CIS </actor> . It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future . <activity_data id=47> The switch-over request </activity_data> is <activity id=56> checked </activity> by <actor id=53> the grid operator </actor> for supplier concurrence , and <actor id=52> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=57> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=58> a response comment </activity_data> . <xor_gateway id=59> In the case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=60> supplier concurrence </condition_specification> <actor id=51> the grid operator </actor> would <activity id=61> inform </activity> <actor id=62> all involved suppliers </actor> and <activity id=63> demand </activity> <activity_data id=64> the resolution of the conflict </activity_data> . <actor id=54> The grid operator </actor> <activity id=65> communicates </activity> with <actor id=66> the old supplier </actor> and <activity id=70> carries out </activity> <activity_data id=71> the termination of the sales agreement </activity_data> between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) . <xor_gateway id=72> If </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=73> there are not any objections by the grid operator </condition_specification> ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor id=10> customer service </actor> <activity id=74> creates </activity> <activity_data id=75> a CIS contract </activity_data> . <actor id=3> The customer </actor> then has the chance to <activity id=78> check </activity> <activity_data id=79> the contract details </activity_data> and based on this check may decide to <xor_gateway id=80> either </xor_gateway> <activity id=81> withdraw </activity> from <activity_data id=76> the switch contract </activity_data> <xor_gateway id=82> or </xor_gateway> <activity id=83> confirm </activity> <activity_data id=77> it </activity_data> . Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) . An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor id=50> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=84> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=85> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor id=12> the customer service </actor> and <actor id=69> the old supplier </actor> <further_specification id=88> via messages containing a services consumption report </further_specification> . <and_gateway id=89> At the same time </and_gateway> , <actor id=49> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=90> computes </activity> <activity_data id=91> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and <activity id=94> sends </activity> <activity_data id=92> it </activity_data> to <actor id=68> the old supplier </actor> . Likewise <actor id=67> the old supplier </actor> <activity id=95> creates </activity> and <activity id=96> sends </activity> <activity_data id=93> the final billing </activity_data> to <actor id=1> the customer </actor> . For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After <activity id=97> receiving </activity> <activity_data id=86> the meter data </activity_data> <actor id=9> customer service </actor> <activity id=98> imports </activity> <activity_data id=87> the meter data </activity_data> to systems that require the information . The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\n\n"], "steps": [["relations"]], "formatter_args": [{"prompt": "pet/re/ablation/no_meta_language.txt", "only_tags": null, "context_tags": null}],

In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them.

These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow.
