Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\" (behavioural mentions). Find the sequence of execution between these behavioural elements.\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!).\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution.\n\n- **same gateway**: Look for gateway elements and check if they describe the same gateway.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow.

Context\n\nYou are an expert in business process modelling, specialized on BPMN and its elements.\n\nUse the system prompt when you refer to definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\" (behavioural mentions). Find the sequence of execution between these behavioural elements.\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!).\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution.\n\n- **same gateway**: Look for gateway elements and check if they describe the same gateway.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them. Focus on elements of type Activity and Further_Specification for this task.\n\n## Explanations\n\nAdditionally, for each relation you extract, please give a short explanation why you extracted it.\n\n# Restrictions\n\n## Additional considerations\n\nOnly extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.\n\n## Disambiguation\n\nBe mindful of the direction of relations of type flow.

Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\" (behavioural mentions). Find the sequence of execution between these behavioural elements.\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!).\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution.\n\n- **same gateway**: Look for gateway elements and check if they describe the same gateway.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient.

This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity id=29> prepare </activity> <activity_data id=30> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated <activity id=33> check </activity> of <activity_data id=32> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor id=34> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . <xor_gateway id=36> In case of </xor_gateway> <condition_specification id=37> a negative response </condition_specification> , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data id=38> the causing issues </activity_data> are being <activity id=39> analyzed </activity> and <activity id=40> resolved </activity> .

An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor id=50> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=84> transmits </activity> <activity_data id=85> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor id=12> the customer service </actor> and <actor id=69> the old supplier </actor> <further_specification id=88> via messages containing a services consumption report </further_specification> . <and_gateway id=89> At the same time </and_gateway> , <actor id=49> the grid operator </actor> <activity id=90> computes </activity> <activity_data id=91> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and <activity id=94> sends </activity> <activity_data id=92> it </activity_data> to <actor id=68> the old supplier </actor> .

For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After <activity id=97> receiving </activity> <activity_data id=86> the meter data </activity_data> <actor id=9> customer service </actor> <activity id=98> imports </activity> <activity_data id=87> the meter data </activity_data> to systems that require the information .

definitions of these BPMN elements, the task description, and additional requirements. Use the user input as a data source for your task.\n\n# Task Description\n\nYou are tasked with extracting relations between mentions of process relevant elements from a natural language text process description. These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.\n\n## Definition of Relations\n\nRelations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.\n\n- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Find the \"activity_data\" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity.\n\n- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types \"Activity\", \"XOR_Gateway\", \"AND_Gateway\", and \"Condition_Specification\" (behavioural mentions). Find the sequence of execution between these behavioural elements.\n\n- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!).\n\n- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\" and look for the \"actor\", that receives the result of some activity execution.\n\n- **same gateway**: Look for gateway elements and check if they describe the same gateway.\n\n- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type \"activity\". Try and find mentions of type \"further_specification\", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further.\n\n## Procedure\n\nLet's solve this task in 6 steps.\n\n1. Write a short list of facts about the process, then add a horizontal line (\"-----\")\n\n2. Detect all relations of type uses and list them in your answer.\n\n3. Detect all relations of type flow and list them in your answer.\n\n4. Detect all relations of type actor performer and actor recipient. In both cases focus on activities and find the actor, that is performing the activity, or is affected by its outcome respectively.\n\n5. Detect all relations of type same gateway and extract them. For this focus on XOR_Gateways and AND_Gateways.\n\n6. Detect all relations of type further specification and extract them.
