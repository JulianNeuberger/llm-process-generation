is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved

supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates

with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21:

constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data

department of TELECO .\n\nSentence 2: At the customer service an employee enters ( based on the received data ) a problem report into system T . .\n\nSentence 3: Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are .\n\nSentence 4: Based on this , the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities .\n\nSentence 5: An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship .\n\nSentence 6: In case the customer is premium , the process will link to an extra problem fix process ( this process will not be detailed here ) .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon , the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues .\n\nSentence 8: Taking together the information ( i.e . contract commitment data + prioritized actions ) a detailed problem report is created .\n\nSentence 9: The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management .\n\nSentence 10: Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers .\n\nSentence 11: After receiving the detailed problem report , Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 12: In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves , the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\n\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\n\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the normal service execution is created .\n\nSentence 16: If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created .\n\nSentence 17: Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management .\n\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\n\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\n\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\n\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\n\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\n\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\n\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\n\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\n\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\n\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\n\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\n\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\n\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\n\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\n\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\n\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\n\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\n\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance

Text\n\nSentence 0: The process is initiated by a switch-over request .\n\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\n\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The

the customer service department of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is <activity> received </activity> by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is <activity> entered </activity> into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be <activity> compared </activity> with the internal customer data base and <activity> checked </activity> for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be <activity> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being <activity> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity> prepare </activity> the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated <activity> check </activity> of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS

doing so , <actor> the customer </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> his data to <actor> the customer service department </actor> of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is <activity> received </activity> by <actor> customer service </actor> and based on this data a customer data object is <activity> entered </activity> into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be <activity> compared </activity> with the internal customer data base and <activity> checked </activity> for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be <activity> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being <activity> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity> prepare </activity> the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated <activity> check </activity> of the contract documents is carried out within <actor> the CIS </actor> ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being <activity> analyzed </activity> and

document is <activity> sent out </activity> to <actor> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to <actor> the grid operator </actor> is automatically <activity> sent out </activity> by <actor> the CIS </actor> .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is <activity> checked </activity> by <actor> the grid operator </actor> for supplier concurrence , and <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence <actor> the grid operator </actor> would <activity> inform </activity> <actor> all involved suppliers </actor> and <activity> demand </activity> the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: <actor> The grid operator </actor> <activity> communicates </activity> with <actor> the old supplier </actor> and <activity> carries out </activity> the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor> customer service </actor> <activity> creates </activity> a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: <actor> The customer </actor> then has the chance to <activity> check </activity> the contract details and based on this check may decide to either <activity> withdraw </activity> from the switch contract or <activity> confirm </activity> it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor> the grid

the old supplier </actor> .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise <actor> the old supplier </actor> <activity> creates </activity> and <activity> sends </activity> the final billing to <actor> the customer </actor> .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After <activity> receiving </activity> the meter data <actor> customer service </actor>
