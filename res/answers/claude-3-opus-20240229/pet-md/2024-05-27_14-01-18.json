sentences, each with their own id (e.g., \"Sentence 0\", \"Sentence 1\" and so on), that describes a business process, where some relevant elements are already marked by xml-like tags. You can use those for additional context.\nThese are spans of text, that are defined as follows:\n\n# Definition\n\n**Condition Specification**: Look for mentions of type XOR_Gateway and extract the condition statement, that follows it directly, if there is any.\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\tCondition Specification\t<sentence>\n\n## Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input. Zero based.\n\n## Format Example\n\nSentence 0: <xor_gateway> if </xor_gateway> the report is of type A the clerk will <activity> review </activity> it for any errors .\nSentence 1: <xor_gateway> otherwise </xor_gateway> it is <activity> archived </activity> .\n\nthe report is of type A\tCondition Specification\t0\n\n# Notes\n\nDo not change the text you extract, i.e., do not correct typos, or change spaces, or add punctuation.\nDo not use any code formatting.\nHuman: Please retrieve all mentions from the following text.\n\n# Text\n\nSentence 0: The process is initiated by a <activity>

<activity_data> customer data </activity_data> <activity> is received </activity> by <actor> customer service </actor> and based on this data a <activity_data> customer data </activity_data> object <activity> is entered </activity> into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After <activity_data> customer data </activity_data> <activity> has been entered </activity> <activity_data> it </activity_data> should then <activity> be compared </activity> with the internal <activity_data> customer data </activity_data> base and <activity> checked </activity> for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: <xor_gateway> In case </xor_gateway> of any errors <activity_data> these </activity_data> should <activity> be corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: <activity_data> The comparison of data </activity_data> <activity> is done </activity> <further_specification> to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times </further_specification> .\n\nSentence 7: <xor_gateway> In case </xor_gateway> <actor> the customer </actor> does not exist in <actor> the customer </actor> data base , <activity_data> a new customer object </activity_data> <activity> is being created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: <activity_data> The generated customer object </activity_data> <activity> is then used </activity> , <further_specification> in combination with other customer data </further_specification> to <activity> prepare </activity> the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of <activity_data> the contract documents </activity_data> <activity> is carried out </activity> <further_specification> within the CIS ( customer information system ) </further_specification> in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: <xor_gateway> In case </xor_gateway> of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , <activity_data> the causing issues </activity_data> <activity> are being analyzed </activity> and <activity> resolved </activity> .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently <activity_data> the contract documents </activity_data> <activity> are generated </activity> <further_specification> once again </further_specification> .\n\nSentence 13: <xor_gateway> In case </xor_gateway> of a positive response <activity_data> a confirmation document </activity_data> <activity> is sent out </activity> to <actor> the customer </actor> stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: <activity_data> A request </activity_data> to <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> is automatically sent out </activity> by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: <activity_data> The switch-over request </activity_data> <activity> is checked </activity> by <actor> the grid operator </actor> for supplier concurrence , and <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> <activity_data> a response comment </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 17: <xor_gateway> In the case of </xor_gateway> supplier concurrence <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> would inform </activity> all involved suppliers and <activity> demand </activity> the resolution of <activity_data> the conflict </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 18: <actor> The grid operator </actor> <activity> communicates </activity> with <actor> the old supplier </actor> and <activity> carries out </activity> the termination of the sales agreement between <actor> the customer </actor> and <actor> the old supplier </actor> ( i.e . <actor> the <actor> </actor> customer service ( of the new supplier ) </actor> does not have to interact with <actor> the old supplier </actor> regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: <xor_gateway> If </xor_gateway> there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor> customer service </actor> <activity> creates </activity> <activity_data> a CIS contract </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 20: <actor> The customer </actor> then has the chance to <activity> check </activity> <activity_data> the contract details </activity_data> and based on <activity_data> this <activity> </activity_data> check </activity> may decide to <xor_gateway> either </xor_gateway> <activity> withdraw </activity> from the switch contract <xor_gateway> or </xor_gateway> <activity> confirm </activity> <activity_data> it </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service <xor_gateway> either </xor_gateway> <activity> ends </activity> ( in case of withdrawal ) <xor_gateway> or </xor_gateway> <activity> continues </activity> ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that <actor> the customer </actor> can only <activity> withdraw </activity> from <activity_data> the offered contract </activity_data> <further_specification> within 7 days </further_specification> <further_specification> after the 7th day </further_specification> <activity_data> the contract </activity_data> <activity> will be regarded </activity> as accepted and the process <activity> continues </activity> .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by <actor> the customer </actor> is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can <activity> speed up </activity> <activity_data> the switch process </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , <further_specification> but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun </further_specification> , <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> <activity_data> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor> the customer service </actor> and <actor> the old supplier </actor> via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: <further_specification> At the same time </further_specification> , <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> computes </activity> <activity_data> the final billing </activity_data> based on the meter data and <activity> sends </activity> <activity_data> it </activity_data> to <actor> the old supplier </actor> .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise <actor> the old supplier </actor> <activity> creates </activity> and <activity> sends </activity> <activity_data> the final billing </activity_data> to <actor> the customer </actor> .\n\nSentence 27: For <actor> the customer </actor> as well as <actor>
