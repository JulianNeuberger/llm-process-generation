Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\tXOR Gateway\t<sentence>\n\n## Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.
